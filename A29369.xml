            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

In the beginning man was truly happy, and though he be now fallen from that happineſs: yet there is a diſpoſition in him ſtill to grope after happineſs. Ye ſee how it is with an Houſe that is burnt down, though it be burnt down to the ground, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pieces of Timber left, though ſcorched, and burnt, and ſpoiled, yet left: and ſo, though Man be fallen, and that goodly building which God Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at the firſt, be now burnt down to the ground; yet there are certain ſcorched and ſpoiled Principles left in him; and what more natural to Man, then to deſire that he may be happy; ſurely therefore there is a diſpoſition ſtill in man, to ſeek after happineſs. Look how far a man knows that a thing is good, ſo far he may act, and ſeek after it; becauſe good is the object of mans will: but every man knows in general, that it is good for him to be happy.</p>

               <p>It's true indeed, that naturally men do not diſtinctly know wherein their happineſs lies; but as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerves, there is a general knowledge of happineſs,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48564:11"/> and there is a diſtinct and right underſtanding of it. Now though all men have not this diſtinct knowledge of our happineſs, yet all men have a general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and they know that its good for them to be happy: ſurely therefore, there is a diſpoſition in all the children of men, to ſeek after ſomething that may make them happy.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>General.</hi> Though there be ſuch a diſpoſition in men, yet they are generally miſtaken in the matter of their happineſs. <hi>Many ſay; Who will ſhew us any good?

Is not he miſtaken that doth place his happineſs in the enjoyment of the Creature? And who doth not ſo? Oh ſays one, if I can but attain to ſuch and ſuch an eſtate, then I ſhall be happy! Oh ſays another, I am now reviled, and reproched, if I can but clear my ſelf, and come off with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then I ſhall be happy!

What man is there that doth not place his happineſs in one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comfort or another. Do not ſome place their happineſs in Pleaſure, ſome in Riches, ſome in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſome in Power, ſome in Health, Strength, and Beauty of Body, ſome in Knowledge, Wit, and Learning, ſome in moral Civil Life, and other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies!

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how comes it to paſs that men are thus miſtaken in the matter of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Sometimes this miſtake doth ariſe from ignorance of the right and true notion of happineſs. If a Country man that hath heard of a King, go up to the Court, and ſee a Knight, or Lord, or Prince come out in fine and brave apparel, he ſaith, lo there is the King, becauſe he knows him not by face, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion he hath of a King, but not having the true notion of his perſon, he is miſtaken, and ſaith, lo, there is my King and Sovereign. So a man having heard that there is ſomething that will make one happy, but not having the right and true notion of it he is thereby miſtaken in the choice of his happineſs, as for example; It is truly ſaid that he that is happy hath what he would; now men turn this principle and ſay, he that hath what he would have is an happy man; and ſo if a wanton hath the embraces of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, then he ſays, now am I happy, becauſe I have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48564:14"/> what I would; ſo if a Drunkard meet with his vain and wicked companion, he ſaith now am I happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have what I would. Whereas in truth, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> Mother ſaid, he is not happy that hath what he would,<note place="margin">Si bona velit &amp; habet beatus eſt, ſi autem mala velit &amp; quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis habeat miſer eſt. <hi>Auguſt. confeſs.</hi>
                  </note> but he that wills aright and then hath what he would, but becauſe men are ignorant thereof, and have not the true notion of happineſs in their hearts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſo miſtaken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes this miſtake doth ariſe from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application of the true notion of happineſs. For what is happineſs, but the enjoyment of that which doth command all things elſe? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut now through miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this notion, men ſay, Mony commands all things, and therefore the more mony I get, the more happy I am, and ſo are miſtaken in the matter of their happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes men are miſtaken herein, becauſe they meaſure their happineſs by their own preſent want. For ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> if you look into your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, ye ſhall find, that if a man be poor,<note place="margin">Ariſtot. Ethic. l. 1.</note> then he thinks it an happineſs to be rich; if a man be diſgraced, then he thinks it is his happineſs to be vindicated, if a man be ſick, then he thinks there is no greater happineſs in the world then to have his health; and ſo men meaſuring their happineſs by their own preſent wants are miſtaken therein.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But ordinarily men are miſtaken in the matter of their happineſs, becauſe they do not hearken to and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48564:14"/> conſider what is ſpoken to them about true happineſs. Famous is that ſtory of <hi>Craeſus</hi> among the Heathens, he was a King of a great Country, and tumbled in his Gold and Silver, and <hi>Solon,</hi> that Wiſeman of <hi>Greece,</hi> coming into his Country, he deſired to ſpeak with him, and when he ſaw him, after <hi>Solon</hi> had ſeen and viewed all his wealth and glory, he asked him, Whom he thought to be the moſt happy man in the world.

                  <hi>Tellus</hi> ſaith he, why <hi>Tellus?</hi> becauſe ſaid <hi>Solon,</hi> he having Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth well, and brought up his child honeſtly and religiouſly, he dyed honourably. Well then ſaid <hi>Craeſus,</hi> but who doſt thou think is the ſecond happy man in the world? I think ſaid he, thoſe two Brothers, that inſtead of Horſes, drew their Mother in a Chariot to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Whereupon ſaid <hi>Craeſus,</hi> what thinkeſt thou of me? I think ſays he, thou art a very rich man; but a man may be happy though he be poor, and a man may be unhappy though he be rich, for he may loſe all his riches before he dye; and therefore, <hi>ante obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nemo,</hi> I think none truly happy, but he that lives well, and dyes well; whereupon that Wiſeman <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was diſmiſſed the Court with neglect: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this <hi>Craeſus</hi> making war againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he was overcome by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and being taken Captive he was laid upon a Pile of Wood to be burned to death, then lying on the Pile of Wood, he cryed out and ſaid, O
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48564:15"/> 
                  <hi>Solon, Solon. Cyrus</hi> enquiring what he meant, then he ſaid, this <hi>Solon</hi> was a Wiſeman of <hi>Greece,</hi> that told me, that happineſs did not conſiſt in riches, for they might all be loſt, and a rich man might dye miſerable, whoſe words ſaid he, I then neglected, but now I find true, and therefore now I cry out and ſay, O <hi>Solon, Solon.</hi> And truely thus it is at this day, Preachers call upon men, and tell them, that our happineſs lyes not in theſe outward things, and they doe not regard it. But there is a time a coming when men will cry out and ſay, O <hi>Solon, Solon;</hi> but for the preſent men will not hear and conſider where their happineſs lyes, and therefore they are thus miſtaken in the matter of their happineſs. But thus now you have heard, that men are miſtaken, and how it comes to paſs that they are ſo miſtaken, and ſo I have done with the Second General, now the Third follows.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Though men are generally miſtaken in the matter of their happineſs, yet there are a generation of men who have found out this happineſs, and are truly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, many ſay who will ſhew us any good, but I ſay otherwiſe; plainly then, there are a generation of men that have found out this happineſs, and are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed; for thoſe that the Scripture calls bleſſed, are bleſſed indeed. Now there are a generation of men whom the Scripture calls bleſſed, and if you would know who theſe are, I will inſtance to you in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture calls them bleſſed, that have their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48564:15"/> ſins pardoned, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquity is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Rom. 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Scripture calls them bleſſed, whom the Lord doth teach the myſteries of his Kingdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou teacheſt out of thy Law.</hi> Mat. 16.17. <hi>Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-jona: <hi>for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it to thee but my father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Scripture calls them <hi>bleſſed that wait on the Poſts of wiſdom, and are made wiſe thereby,</hi> Prov. 8.35. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, and waiteth daily at my gates, watching at the Poſts of my door.</hi> Prov. 3.13. <hi>Happy is the man that findeth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and getteth underſtanding;</hi> ſo again, v. 18, <hi>And happy is every one that retaineth her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Scripture calls them bleſſed that are of a meek, humble, and a pure ſpirit, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit. Bleſſed are the pure in heart. Bleſſed are the meek in ſpirit.</hi> Mat. 5.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Scripture calls them <hi>bleſſed that do walk in Gods ways, and not in the ways of the world,</hi> Pſal. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful, but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth meditate day and night.</hi> So Pſal. 119.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that is undefiled in the way;</hi> and ſo again, Pſal. 112.1. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man that feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Scripture calls them bleſſed <hi>that ſuffer for Chriſt, his way, and truth, and name.</hi> Mat. 5. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men perſecute and revile you for my name-ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48564:16"/>
               <p>Seventhly, The Scripture calls them <hi>bleſſed that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the poor Saints and people of God, who have bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of love and compaſſions.</hi> Pſal. 41. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that conſidereth the poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, The Scripture calls them <hi>bleſſed that know and doe the work of their place and office, both to God and man.</hi> John 13.17. <hi>I ſay unto you ſaith Chriſt, the Servant is not greater then the Lord, if ye know theſe things; happy are ye if you do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, The Scripture calls them <hi>bleſſed that wait and prepare for the deliverance of the Churches, and the coming of Chriſt: behold I come as a Thief, bleſſed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments.</hi> Rev. 16.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, The Scripture calls them <hi>bleſſed that dye in the Lord, and are found ſo doing when Chriſt comes, bleſſed is that ſervant whom when the Lord comes he ſhall find ſo doing,</hi> Mat. 24. <hi>And bleſſed are thoſe that dye in the Lord.</hi> Rev. 14.13. Do you therefore ask who is this bleſſed man, the man that is truly bleſſed, the Scripture tells you in all theſe particulars, ſo that doubtleſs there is a generation of men that have found this happineſs, and are truly bleſſed, that is the third General, now the fourth follows.</p>
               <p>Fourth General.</p>
               <p>Wherein the true bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs or happineſs doth conſiſt;<note place="margin">Beatitudo formalis conſiſtit in fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itione beatitudinis objectivae, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo autem objectva eſt Deus: quia eſt bonum perfectum ſatiens appetitum.</note> the Text tells you, <hi>in the light of Gods countenance and the ſhine of his face;</hi> for look wherein God did command the Prieſts of old
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48564:16"/> for to bleſs his people, therein true bleſſedneſs muſt needs conſiſt; now if ye look into the ſixth of <hi>Numbers,</hi> ye ſhall find that therein God commanded <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons for to bleſs the people, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. on this wiſe ye ſhall bleſs the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Lord bleſs thee and keep thee, the Lord make his face to ſhine upon thee and be gracious unto thee, the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee;</hi> and if you look into <hi>Pſalm</hi> 67, 1. ye ſhall find that when the Pſalmiſt prayed for a bleſſing, he prayed thus, <hi>The Lord be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto us, and bleſs us, and cauſe his face to ſhine upon us.</hi> Surely therefore the happineſs and bleſſedneſs of man muſt needs lye and conſiſt in the light of Gods countenance, and the ſhine of his face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if our bleſſedneſs doth conſiſt herein, then ſome of Gods own people are not bleſſed? For God doth hide his face from ſome of them, and how many are there, even amongſt the Saints that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſaying, <hi>Oh, the face of God doth not ſhine on me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> True they do ſo, and its poſſible that God may hide his face from his own Children for a time; but what Child of God is there in all the world, but the face of God hath ſhined upon. It is poſſible that a Child of a natural Father, may never ſee the face of his Father, his Father may be dead before he is born; but no child of God but hath ſeen his Fathers face: for what is the face of God but his favour; and what is the ſhine thereof but the manifeſtation of his favour; and when God pardoned his ſin at the firſt, did not he manifeſt his love and favour to him? And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48564:17"/> doth he not daily do it in ſupporting him with his Arm? In the times of the old Teſtament, the Saints did mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the favour of God too much by outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and bleſſings, becauſe the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was promiſed them as a favour from God, when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did break in upon them they ſaid, That God did then hide his face from them; but ye know how is is with the day, if it be day the Sun ſhines, and though ye ſee not the beams thereof, yet you ſee the light thereof; ſo here, though you ſee not the beams of Gods countenance, yet if it be day with you, you ſee the light thereof. Now it is day with all the Children of God, they are Children of the day; and therefore whatever they ſay or think, there is none of Gods Children, but the face of God doth or hath ſhined upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall I know that the face of God hath ever ſhined on my Soul, for there are many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions about this matter? How ſhall I therefore know that God hath ever lift up the light of his Countenance upon my Soul?</p>
               <p>5. <hi>General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is the 5th. General, therefore I ſhall now ſpeak to that. <hi>Anſ.</hi> If God hath ever bleſſed you in truth, then hath his face ſhined upon you; for his bleſſing and the ſhine of his face go together, as ye have heard. Now when God bleſſes a man, then he draws him nearer to himſelf. <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>whom then cauſeſt to approch unto thee;</hi> when God bleſſes a man, then he makes him to encreaſe and multiply; if he bleſs him in his eſtate,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48564:17"/> then he doth increaſe and multiply therein; if he bleſs him in his parts, or gifts, or graces, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; then he cauſeth him to increaſe therein: ſo at the beginning the Lord bleſſed Man and ſaid, <hi>increaſe and multiply.</hi> And therefore if thou haſt been ſuch an one as hath lived at a diſtance from God, and now at brought nigh to him, and increaſed in thy gifts, graces, and comforts, then hath the Lord bleſſed thy Soul, and ſo hath ſhined on thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48564:23"/> Surely therefore our affection to theſe outward things, is in compariſon to be as no affection. But our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are to be ſet and placed on things that are above, not on things that are below, <hi>but on things above.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why are we thus to ſet and place our affections on things that are above?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There are many great and important rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all which are as ſo many proofs of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> 1. If you do not ſet your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Chriſt, and the things of Chriſt, you are no fit match for him; you will not be found marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageable unto the Lord Chriſt; that woman is not fit to be married to a man, whoſe affections are not drawn out, and knit to him; and if your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be not drawn out to Chriſt, and the things of Chriſt, you are no fit match for Chriſt. Now we muſt all be eſpouſed to Chriſt, and married to him, as the Church, ſo every believer is the true Spouſe of Chriſt; but the Spouſe of Chriſt ye cannot be, unleſs your affections be drawn out to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. As you cannot be married to Chriſt unleſs your affections be ſet on him, and the <hi>things above;</hi> ſo you will never own him, unleſs your affections be ſet on him. 'Tis the duty of all the Saints, to own Chriſt, his ways, his truths, his ordinances; <hi>He that is aſhamed of me before Men, him will I be aſhamed off, before my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, Now look what that is which a man doth much affect, that he will own and not be aſhamed of; but if a man doth not affect a thing, he will not own it, but will be aſhamed of it; but we muſt own Chriſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48564:24"/> here, or he will not own us hereafter. Surely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very fit and neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry, that our affections be ſet on Chriſt, and the <hi>things above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. If your affections be not ſet upon things above, they will never be drawn off from things here beneath; 'tis the gracious affection that doth mortifie carnal affection. Sin is ever truly mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the contrary good; the joy of the World, by the joy of Heaven; worldly grief, by Spiritual grief; the Snow is not melted, but by the warm Beams of the Sun; and the more your hearts are warmed and drawn out with love to Chriſt, the more your love and affections to the World will be mortified. Now is it not neceſſary that our affections ſhould be drawn off from things here below. Surely therefore it is fit and neceſſary for us to ſet and place our affections upon Chriſt, and the <hi>things above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. If your affections be not ſet upon <hi>things above,</hi> ſpiritual and heavenly things, you will never preſs much after the knowledge and obtainment of them. Ye ſee how it is with a Child, if he have no affections to his book, he will never make a Schollar; and ſo if you have no affections to the things of Chriſt, you will never make a Schollar in the School of Chriſt. Great is the power of affections, as it's ſaid of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>Magna eſt vis conſcientiae in utramque partem,</hi> Great is the force of Conſcience either way, for truth or errour; ſo I may ſay of affections, <hi>Magna eſt vis affectionum in utramque partem,</hi> great is the force of affections either way, to put us on to evil or good. Look what a man hath an affection too that he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth after. Now is it not our duty to preſs after the knowledge of Chriſt. Surely therefore it is very
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48564:24"/> fit and requiſite that we ſhould place our affections on <hi>things above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5ly. If your affections be not thus ſet, you will never be zealous for God: for what is zeal but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred Love; it is ſaith one, <hi>Divinae Charitatis fervor,</hi> the heat of divine Love. Surely it is the top and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of affection. Now is it not our duty to be zealous for Chriſt. <hi>The zeal of thine houſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath eaten me up, and ſhall the zeal of our own houſes eat us up?</hi> Zeal is commanded in oppoſition to Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs; <hi>Be zealous therefore, and repent,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to lukewarm <hi>Laodicea,</hi> but zealous we cannot be for God and the things of God, unleſs our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be ſet on things that are above.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. If our affections be not thus ſet on <hi>things above,</hi> you will never do any great thing for God. We read of <hi>David,</hi> that he gave 347. Millions, 382. thouſand, 50<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And what is the reaſon that men give and do no more now for God; but becauſe their affections are not ſet on the things of God, but if God have done great things for us; and Chriſt have ſuffered great things for us, ſhall not we do ſome great things for him; this ye cannot do unleſs your affections be thus ſet. Surely therefore it is our duty to ſet our affections on things that are above.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48564:25"/>7ly. If your affections be not thus ſet, you can never pleaſe God in any thing that you do for God: for as he requireth truth in the inward parts,<note place="margin">Affectum non vocem audit Deus. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </note> ſo he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that we ſhould ſerve him with fervency of Spirit;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Be fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Rom 12.11.

Go and offer it to thy Prince</hi> ſaith God. Do you think that I will accept your Female affections? No ſaith the Lord, if you would have acceptance with me, I muſt have the beſt, and the Maſculine affections from you. Surely therefore it is very fit and neceſſary that our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be ſet and placed on things that are above.</p>

So that 'tis affection that intangles, and the more we are affected with any thing, the more we are intangled with it; and the more our hearts are intangled with any thing, the harder it is to part, and to be looſned from it. Would you not therefore part or be looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Chriſt, and the things of Chriſt: then ſurely you muſt ſet your affections on him, and on things above. Thus upon all theſe conſiderations and reaſons, ye ſee it is the duty of all the Saints to ſet their affections on things that are above.</p>

               <p n="1">1; It is an hard and difficult thing thus to ſet our affections on <hi>things above:</hi> For he that doth truly ſet his affections on <hi>things above,</hi> hath his Sympathy and Antipathy changed; look what that is which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had an Antipathy againſt, that he now hath a Sympathy with; and that which he had a Sympathy with, that he now hath an Antipathy againſt. Now is it not an hard thing to change our Antipathies into Sympathies, and our Sympathies into Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies?

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>But by way of convincement in the 4th. place. 1.

So ſpiritually, though the work of Mortification and Repentance be an hard work, yet it is eaſie to ſome, prayer eaſie, reading eaſie, meditating eaſie. why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have affection to theſe things: but if your affections be not ſet on things that are above, how ſhall the wayes of God be made eaſie and ſweet unto you? But beſides all theſe things, ye know that</p>
               <p n="6">6. God is a jealous God; and though Chriſt be a loving Husband unto every ſoul that is eſpouſed to him, yet he is very jealous of mens affections. What man is not jealous of his Wife when he ſees that her affections are placed upon another? And are our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections placed upon things below, what doth that do but raiſe the jealouſie of Chriſt againſt us? Jealouſie is the rage of man, what is it then in Chriſt? Now therefore as you deſire, that the jealouſie of the Lord Jeſus may not be raiſed againſt you, that the ways of God may be made ſweet and eaſie to you, that you may never loſe your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,

               <p n="5">5. And be much in meditation, for as reading and hearing doe beget knowledge, ſo meditation doth beget affections; either therefore you are in company, or you are alone; if you be in company mutual Exhortation will quicken your affections unto what is good; if ye be alone, then ſit and meditate on the things that you have heard, or read, or ſeen, or done, and thus your affections will, and ſhall be raiſed unto things above.</p>

               <p n="2">2. In caſe you feel your affections begin to ool and decline then ſtir up your ſelf, and the grace of God that is in you. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complains that none ſtirred up themſelves to take hold on God. The like complaint may we take up now; for what is the reaſon that our affections dye, and cool away after raiſings of heart, but becauſe we doe not ſtir up our ſelves and hearts to take hold on God; in caſe therefore that your affe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="3">3 Be ſure that you make uſe of the varietie in the ways of God, which he hath given you, <hi>varietas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focillat; variety is refreſhing and affecting,</hi> God hath given us divers ordinances to be exerciſed in, that if we be dull and weary in one, we may go to another, if you be weary in prayer, you may go to reading; if weary in reading, then go to meditating; if weary in meditation, you may go to conference; if you will ſpend your ſelf only in one duty, there will grow a dulneſs and deadneſs upon you; but if you exerciſe your ſelf according to that variety which God hath given you, your heart will be kept up with an holy freſhneſs unto things above. But,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48564:31"/>4. Becauſe that we are much affected with new things, therefore ſtudy the words and works of God much, and be always digging in them, then ſome new truth, or new diſcovery will ariſe upon you, which will affect your heart, and ever heap up your affections unto things above. And</p>
               <p n="5">5. In caſe that you have any great affections unto what is good, be ſure that you labour more and more to refine that affection; things refined keep longeſt, Diſtilled Waters keep longer then the leaves out of which the waters are diſtilled; if ye have Roſe leaves they will not keep freſh ſo long as the water that you diſtill from them; thoſe affections that you now have, it may be, are ſweet unto you, but they are as the Roſe leaves, ſomewhat of a droſſier matter, which doth adhere to them, if you would now take thoſe very good affections and Refine or Diſtil the ſame, then would they keep the longer. Go then and carry in your Roſe leaves unto Gods-Still, and labour more and more to refine your beſt affections. Thus your affections ſhall not only be ſet on things above, but be ſetled on them.</p>
               <p>And my Beloved, is it not a good and bleſſed thing to have ſweet and large affections for good? Surely it is a great mercy to have large affections in good and for good; ſome of us have had large affections to the things of the world, and ſhall we not have as large af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections unto things that are above. Old men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally want affections, and young people doe abound therein; but what will all our affections doe us good, if they be ſet on things here below? Alas we ſhall but loſe them, and the things affected too. But if you
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48564:31"/> ſet your affections on things above, you ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe your affections, nor the things affected. Wherefore let us all receive this Exhortation, <hi>Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the Earth.</hi>

Why, but ſuppoſe a man be called being a Servant, is he to abide therein? Yes, ſaies the Apoſtle, verſe 20. <hi>Let every one abide in the ſame calling wherein he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> Art thou called being a ſervant, care not for it, but if thou maieſt be made free, uſe it rather; for verſe 22. <hi>He that is called in the Lord, being a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is the Lords Freeman</hi> only ſaith he, <hi>ye are bought with a price; be not ye the Servants of men,</hi> ſerving men only, but the Lord in them. And ſo Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let every man wherein he is called, abide with God by calling; ſo the Apoſtle doth underſtand that ſtate and condition wherein God hath placed us. We do ordinarily take the word calling for our civil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and outward occupation; but the Apoſtle takes it here for our outward ſtate and condition, yet not excluding, but including the other, for there is no ſtate or condition that we are called unto, but ſome occupation, imployment, or calling, is to be uſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and therefore in ſpeaking to one of theſe, I ſhall ſpeak to both and ſo the Doctrine is this.</p>
               <p>That it is the duty of every man to abide or walk with God in his calling, take calling for your ſtate or condition, or take calling for your ordinary way of imployment; the Doctrine is true, that it is our duty <hi>to abide or walk with God in our calling.</hi> It is commanded in the 17 <hi>verſe, As the Lord hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led every one, ſo let him walk.</hi> It is commanded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the 20 verſe <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling wherein he was called.</hi> And it is commanded
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48564:33"/> again in the 24 verſe, <hi>Brethren let every one, &amp;c.</hi> Surely therefore there is ſome great concernment in this, and the 20 verſe he ſaith, <hi>Let every man abide,</hi> but in the 17 he ſaith, <hi>as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk;</hi> and ſaith the Text, <hi>here let him abide with God.</hi> Plainly then, it is the duty of every man to walk or abide with God in his calling. For the proſecuting of which Truth, I ſhall labour to ſhew you,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is a great mercy for a man to be placed in a good, lawful, and honeſt calling. A good calling is a great mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That a man being ſo placed, is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide therein.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. That it is our duty to walk with God in our calling.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What a man ſhould do, that he may walk with God in his calling.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I ſhall give you ſome motives and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to provoke you to this work of walking with God in your callings.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore I ſay, A good calling is a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; it is a great mercy for a man to have an honeſt, good, and a lawful calling: whether you take the word calling for the calling of condition, or for the calling of employment, it is a great mercy to be planted in an honeſt and a lawful calling. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, This was the condition of <hi>Adam</hi> in the State of Innocency; then the Lord ſet <hi>Adam</hi> for to Till the Ground; he gave him an imployment in the State of Innocency, and there was nothing given him in the State of Innocency, but mercy; whatever God

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48564:34"/> therefore it is a great mercy to be on this ground, to have an honeſt lawful calling and employment. And that is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now Secondly, A man having an honeſt and a good calling, he is to abide therein. <hi>Let every one abide therein,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, here again and again. Now for the opening of this, I ſhall briefly ſpeak unto theſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an aptneſs in us to change or lay down our Callings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is not abſolutely unlawful ſo to do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet ordinarily a man is to abide in his Calling, and not readily to be removed from it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſhall anſwer to ſome objections, or caſes of Conſcience about the change or relinquiſhment of our calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Therefore there is an aptneſs in us to change or lay down our Callings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why ſhould the Apoſtle three times one after another, call upon us <hi>to abide in our callings.</hi> And if ye look into 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. ye ſhall find that as ſoon as the Apoſtle had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Theſſalonians to work, and eat their own bread by working. verſe</hi> 10. he preſently adds, <hi>But ye Brethren, be not weary of well doing.</hi> Why ſo! But becauſe there is an aptneſs in us, and an itching diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to leave and deſert our Callings</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it is not abſolutely unlawful for a man to leave, or to change his Calling. This in ſome caſes thou mayſt do, ſays <hi>Pet. Mart. Modo teipſum non quaeras, vel temere agas; ſo that you do not ſeek your ſelf, nor be raſh therein.</hi> For poſſibly a man may be qualified for higher employments then his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48564:35"/> own calling beats. In this caſe <hi>David</hi> left his calling of a Shepherd, and became a King. <hi>Amos</hi> left the calling of a Herd-man, and became a Prophet. The Apoſtles left the calling of their fiſhing, and became Apoſtles. Poſſibly a man may be qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for better and higher employments; and in that caſe it is lawful to change or leave his calling. Or,

               <p n="2">2. Poſſibly a man may ſee the ſame hand of God leading him out of his calling, which did bring him in to it. So when <hi>Noah</hi> had the ſame Command to go out of the Ark, that he had to go in, then he went out, but n t before; thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Poſſibly the Porter that ſtandeth at the door of a mans Calling may let him out; there are Porters which God hath ſet at the door of every condition; if a m n be a ſingle man, and would change his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and his Parents are unwilling, then he may not go out of that calling or condition: For the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents which are the Porters of the door do not open to him. There are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orters at the door of every condition, poſſibly this Porter may open the door, and then it is lawful for a man to change or lay down his Calling. Or,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Poſſibly a man may be forced through want,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48564:35"/> to change or deſert his calling. <hi>Paul</hi> though a Preacher and Apoſtle, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forced to work with his hands.<note place="margin">Idem statuendum est, cum aliqua gravi ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate compelleris, &amp; ſubeas novas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiones. <hi>Pet. Mar.</hi> ibid.</note> And though <hi>Muſculus</hi> was a good and excellent Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet he was ſometimes forced to work, and to dig in the City Ditch or moat, for his living. Poſſibly I ſay, a man through urgent neceſſity and want, may be forced to leave or deſert his Calling; and then, and in that caſe, it is lawful for him to do it: So that it is not abſolutely unlawful for a man to change or lay down his Calling. Yet,</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Though it be lawful in ſome caſe to do ſo, yet ordinarily a man is to abide in his calling, and not readily to be removed from it: for a good calling is the Lords gift.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is God that calls a man to that ſtate, condition or employment, Now a man ſhould not readily leave or deſert that calling or employment which God hath called him to, or owned and bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in. For how do I know whether God will own or bleſs me when I ſhall deſert that Calling, wherein he hath appeared unto me. 'Tis my Duty to follow God, and not to go before him; as God hath diſtributed to every man. As the Lord hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every man, ſo let him walk. God doth diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and carve our our callings for us. Has the Lord therefore called me to a place or employment, then am I with thankfulneſs to walk therein. 'Tis not for the private Souldier, ſaith <hi>P. Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> to appoint his own ſtation; but look where he is ſet by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, there he is to abide. Has the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48564:36"/> ſet me in this or that calling or employment, then am to wait on God, and abide in it, and not readily to be removed from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no calling either of employment or condition, but God may be ſerved and enjoyed therein. No calling or employment ſo mean, but a man may honourably ſerve, and comfortably enjoy God therein. Art thou called being a Servant, care not ſaith the Apoſtle; Why! For he that is cal ed being a Servant, is the <hi>Lords Free-man.</hi> verſe 22. Likewiſe alſo, he that is called being free, is the <hi>Lords Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> I rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mber I heard a Preacher ſay ſome 25. years ſince, that a man is never aſhamed of his Calling though it be never ſo mean, but a man is aſhamed of his ſin, although he be never ſo great. If ſays he, you call a man Tincker or Cobler, yet he is not aſhamed thereof, becauſe it is his Calling; but if you call a man Drunkard, or Adulterer, he is aſhamed thereof, becauſe that is none of his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A man may honourably ſerve God in his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it be never ſo mean, and he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably enjoy God in his Calling although it be never ſo great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But that is the reaſon why I would lay down my Calling, becauſe I cannot ſerve God ſo well therein. I meet with many Temptations, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, and Impediments, which hinder me in the ſervice of God; if I were free from this Calling, then I ſhould be more free for God, and ſhould be more free from thoſe ſnares and provocations that I now meet with. But for anſwer:</p>

                  </gap>y do? but lay the fault of their anger and provocation, upon their condition, and excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That that comes from within, that defiles the man, not that which comes from without.</hi> 'Tis not the condition or the place, or the employment or calling that defiles the man, but that that comes from within, that defiles the man. Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> being asked whether a man might avoid the doing of a thing whereunto he is called;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greenham</hi> on Calling.</note> becauſe he feels corruption in himſelf. He ſaid, In avoiding Society, you ſhall cover, but not cure your infirmities; and though you depart from men, you cannot go out of your ſelf, 'tis not the uſe of the Creatures, but the love of the Creatures, that hinder from good. I never look ſaid be, for a better eſtate then that wherein I am; but I oft prepare for a worſe. And I pray tell me, Beloved, was not <hi>Joſhua</hi> (when <hi>Moſes</hi> dyed, and he was to lead the people into <hi>Canaan</hi>) a man of great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. <hi>Yet even then</hi> (ſaith the Lord to him) <hi>this book of the Law, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night.</hi> Joſh. 1.8. And was not <hi>David</hi> a man of great employments?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48564:37"/> yet, ſays he, <hi>At Evening, Morning, and at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day will I pray, yea ſeven times a day; yea I meditate on thy Law all the day long.</hi> Surely therefore our hinderance to good, doth not lye in our calling, place, or employment; but it lies within our ſelves. And therefore why ſhould we lay down our callings to be rid thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But this is not my reaſon, I know that a man may ſerve God in the worſt of honeſt callings, but callings are made for maintenance. Now I have enough to maintain my ſelf and mine; and therefore why may not I now lay down my calling?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe you are miſtaken. A calling is not onely to maintain your ſelf and your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amily, but it is an ordinance of God to preſerve and keep you from Idleneſs: whereby you are not onely to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your ſelf, but to help others. And therefore ye find that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he wrought with his hands;</hi> not onely to maintain himſelf but others. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.34. <hi>You know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>yea, your ſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtred unto my neceſſities, and to them that were with me.</hi> He did not onely work occaſionally to maintain himſelf, but others alſo. And if ye look into the 4th. chapter of the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> The ſame Church that he ſpake to in the 20th. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> ye ſhall find that he layeth his injunction on them and us. <hi>Let him that ſtole ſteal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> verſe 28. Surely therefore a calling is not onely appointed to raiſe a maintenance for our ſelves and therefore though you can live, &amp; have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means enough to maintain both you, and others,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48564:37"/> yet you may not therefore leave or deſert your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is that truſt that God hath committed to you, and you muſt make good your truſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But though I may not leave my calling al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, yet may I not leave it for a time, that on the week day I may go and hear and enjoy the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes ſurely, for man is not made for the calling, but the calling is made for man. Ye read of a converted Woman in the 4th of <hi>John,</hi> that when ſhe had a taſt of Chriſts Preaching, ſhe left her Pitcher or Pail, and went and called others to hear the ſame. And ſo, though you do not break your Pail or Pitcher, yet you may leave your Pail or Pitcher for a time, to tend on the words of Chriſt. Did not the <hi>Jews</hi> go up three times in the year to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from their ſeveral Habitations, Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Callings. Is it not ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. <hi>That the converted Jews did continue daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe.</hi> Indeed God will have mercy and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but though ye may not leave or lay down your callings readily, yet for a time you may leave them, that you may attend on the ordinances. But though you may ſo leave your callings for a time, yet you muſt abide therein with God. And ſo I come to the 3d. <hi>General,</hi> which is this:</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>General.</hi> That it is our duty, or the duty of every man to walk with God in his calling, not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to abide therein, but to abide and walk with God therein. For thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was ſo from the beginning. <hi>Adam</hi> had a call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even in <hi>the ſtate of innocency,</hi> but therein he was to walk with God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48564:38"/>2. And if a man do not walk with God in his calling, how can he walk with God at all. A man is not ſaid to walk with God, becauſe he prays in the morning or evening; walking is a conſtant thing. Now it is the duty of every man to walk with God; and therefore 'tis his duty to walk with God in his calling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thereby a man is diſtinguiſhed from the world and the men of the world. A man is not therefore one of another world, becauſe he deſerts his calling that he may give himſelf unto his devotions: For then the <hi>Moncks,</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſhould be men and women of another world; he is a man of another world, <hi>that doth uſe the world as if he uſed it not.</hi> Chriſt himſelf was in the world, <hi>but not of the world.</hi> And if you would not be of the world, you muſt not go out of the world, but you muſt walk with God in the world. Hereby you ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from the world, and men of the world. Now it is our duty ſo to walk, as it may appear that we are not of this world. Therefore it is our duty to walk with God in our callings, not not onely to abide therein, but to walk with God therein.</p>

This is that which will ſweeten and elevate your callings, every thing is raiſed or depreſſed as God is preſent with it, or abſent from it. <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was but a little City, therefore ſays the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha.</hi> Chap. 5.3. <hi>Thou</hi> Beth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. its ſaid. <hi>And thou</hi> Beth-lehem <hi>art not the leaſt;</hi> Why! <hi>becauſe Chriſt was born there.</hi> Look what place or Town, or condition that is, where Chriſt is, though it be little in it ſelf, yet it is raiſed by him. The more therefore that you walk with God in your calling, the more your calling is ſweetned and elevated. And yet farther,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Every man is, as he is in his calling, a man hath no more grace then he may or can uſe in his calling; and though I have all parts and gifts, ſo as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mountains; yet if I be not gracious in my call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all is nothing; my parts and gifts are but as <hi>ſounding Braſs,</hi> and as <hi>tinckling Cymbal.</hi> My calling is that ground whereon I am to plant all my gifts and graces If I have grace, it will appear in my call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if I be wicked, it will appear in my calling; every man is as he is his calling. Surely therefore it is not onely o r duty to abide, but to abide and walk with God in our callings. And that is the third General.</p>
               <p>Now by way of Application I might ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in reference to every branch of the Doctrine. If a good calling be a great mercy, then why ſhould not Parents provide honeſt callings for their Child, and Children be thankful to God and their Parents for ſuch proviſion? And if it be our duty to abide with God in our callings, then why ſhould not every man be contented with his condition whatever it be,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48564:39"/> though it be never ſo mean? And if it be our duty to walk with God in our callings, then why ſhould we not make it our buſineſs (not to be rich by our callings) but to walk with God in our callings. But you will ſay in the 4th. place:</p>

               <p n="2">2. If you would walk with God in your calling, you muſt not be negligent in your place and calling. Diligence in our callings, is commanded, commended, and rewarded in Scripture. Its commanded, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in the power of thy hand to do, do it with all thy might.

Then ſurely you cannot walk with God, and be negligent therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you would walk with God in your calling, you muſt not deal unjuſtly or unrighteouſly in your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with men. <hi>God hath ſhewed thee O man, what is good,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Plainly then a man cannot walk humbly with God, that doth not deal juſtly and righteouſly with men in his calling.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would walk with God in your calling, then you muſt not be too familiar with your calling. God hath given you a calling that it may be a Nurſe to you, and your grace. Children ſometimes are ſo fond of their Nurſe, that they regard not their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48564:40"/> and if you be too fond of your calling, you will forget the God of your calling. <hi>Let him that marrieth be as if he married not,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>and he that uſeth the world, as if he uſed it not.</hi> You will go with an Apron into your ſhop, that you may keep your Cloths clean. And hath not your Soul as much need of an Apron when you are in your ſhop and your calling. If the Ivy clings too cloſe unto the Oak, it hindereth the growth of the Oak. So if your callings cling too cloſe to you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48564:40"/>2. If you would walk with God in your calling, then you muſt live by Faith in your callings. <hi>For by Faith</hi> Enoch <hi>walked with God. And the life that I live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> Thereby you ſhall be kept from Covetouſneſs, and love of the World. <hi>This is our Victory whereby we overcome the world, even our Faith.</hi> Thereby you ſhall be contented with your condition whatever it be; thereby you ſhall be able to leap over a Wall, and over all thoſe difficulties that you meet within your callings; thereby you ſhall live ſweetly and graciouſly in your calling, and walk with God. Now if you would live by faith in your calling, then you muſt have an eye to Gods commandment, promiſe, and providence. Firſt, you muſt go to your callings as to Gods ordinance otherwiſe you cannot look with both eyes to God, but with one eye to the world, and with the other to God. But you ſee that he hath taught us, That you cannot look with one eye to Heaven, and with the other eye to the Earth; but if you will look to the Heavens, both eyes will look to Heaven. So if you will look to God, you muſt look with both eyes to God. The way th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore to look with both eyes to God in your calling, is to go to your calling, as to Gods ordinance; and becauſe Faith and the promiſe, are as Buckle and Claſp, the one cannot be without the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt obſerve thoſe promiſes that are made to your calling, and reſt thereon. And becauſe God doth ſometimes guid us by his eye in the way of our callings, therefore you muſt have an eye to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and whatever you do in the way of your calling, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48564:41"/> ſucceſs to God. And thus ſhall you live by faith in your calling, and ſo walk with God in your place.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If you would walk with God in your calling, then whatever you do therein, do all to the glory of God. <hi>Whether you eat or drink</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>do all to the glory of God.</hi> If I work in my calling for mine own profit onely, then I walk with my ſelf therein; but if I do all for Gods glory, not mine own profit, then I walk with God in my calling</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would walk with God in your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling, then be ſure that you ſo manage your calling, that your general calling may not be an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, but an help unto your particular: And thus your particular calling may be no hindrance, but an help to your general calling. Wo to that calling which eats up Prayer! The particular and general callings are joined together by God. <hi>Thoſe that God hath joined together, let no man put aſunder.</hi> Be ſure therefore that your general calling be an help to your particular, and your particular no hindrance to your general. Thus ſhall you walk with God in your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the fifth place.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you would walk with God in your calling, then be ſure that you turn as God turns, ſweetly complying with his diſpenſations in the way of your calling. If two men walk together, when one turns, the other turns; and if one do not turn as the other turns, they cannot walk together; but if one turns as the other turns, then they walk together. So in our walking with God, it may be Gods diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in my calling is comfortable, then am I to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and to praiſe the Lord. It may be God turns and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48564:41"/> his diſpenſation is ſad, in the way of my calling, then am I to humble my ſelf before the Lord, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his diſpenſation; which if you do in your calling, then ſhall you walk with God therein. Yet,</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you would walk with God in your calling, then you muſt judge of things in your calling, as God judges, and meaſures things by his Buſhel. We are very apt to meaſure, and judge of things in our call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by the verdict of the means and ſecond cauſes; if the means and ſecond cauſe ſmile, then we ſmile, though God frown; if the means and ſecond cauſe frown, then we frown, though God ſmile; if the ſecond cauſe be big, and promiſe a great mercy or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to us, then in the ſtrength of the ſecond cauſe, we promiſe it to our ſelves, though God threatens the contrary; if the ſecond cauſe or means threaten a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then in the ſtrength thereof, we threaten our ſelves with that miſery, though God promiſe the contrary bleſſing. That is not to walk with God in our callings. He that walks with God in his place and calling, muſt judge and meaſure things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Gods verdict. But,</p>
               <p n="7">7. If you would walk with God in your place and calling, then you muſt ſpiritualize your particular call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with heavenly things, and the things of God, not put all upon a morning and an evening prayer; but your particular calling muſt be ſprinkled with holy Meditations, and gracious Speeches. Thus it was with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant when he went for <hi>Rebeccah, He ſprinkled his Service, with meditation, prayer, and godly speech.</hi> And if ye look into the 5th. of <hi>Judges,</hi> ye ſhall find that upon a glorious Victory
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48564:42"/> that God gave to his people, its ſaid <hi>verſe</hi> 11. <hi>They that are delivered from the noiſe of the Archers, in the Places of drawing of water, there ſhall they rehearſe the righteous acts of the Lord.</hi> Not onely at their Church-meetings, and in prayer or duty, but while they are <hi>drawing of water.</hi> Thus our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling is to be ſprinkled with heavenly things; and if you do thus, then ſhall you walk with God in your calling. And oh that there were an heart in us all, thus to walk with God in our callings. This is every mans work, and every days work. Now therefore that you may do it, give me leave by way of motive, to leave theſe few conſiderations with you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you walk with God in your particular call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God will walk with you in your general calling. Is it not a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat mercy to meet with God in your prayers and duties; if you go up to him in your particular callings, he will come down to you in your general.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then ſhall your calling be a bleſſing to you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and you ſhall have another further and greater reward then the wealth of your calling. <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Servants obey your Maſters in all things, not with eye ſervice as men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſs of heart, fearing the Lord.</hi> verſe 22, <hi>And whatever ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord, and not unto men.</hi> verſe 23. <hi>Knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the reward of the inheritance; for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi> It ſeems then by this Scripture, that though a man be a Servant, yet therein he may ſerve the Lord, and walk with God; and if he do ſo, he ſhall not onely have wages from his Maſter; but of the Lord he ſhall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48564:42"/> receive the reward of the Inheritance. Now he is beſt paid, which the Lord pays; the Lord will not onely give him his outward wages, but an everlaſting inheritance. Oh what a good thing it is to walk with God in our callings. Yea.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thereby the knots and difficulties of your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhall be taken of, and your way made eaſie; that God whom ye walk with in your callings, will lift you over all the ſtiles that are in your callings. If a Child walk with his Father in the Fields, when they come at an high Stile, the Father lifts him over it. So if you walk with God in your callings, then he will lift you over all the Stiles and Difficulties of your callings. Yea,</p>
               <p n="4">4 Thereby you ſhall be kept from the ſins and temptations of your calling. A mans calling is like to a great Logg, or piece of Timber in a green field; look upon the field, and you ſee it all green and handſome, but take up the Logg, or Timber that lies in the midſt thereof, and there you find Worms, and Sows, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min that do breed under it. So look upon a mans carriage, and generally it is very green, civil, and handſome; but if ye look under his calling, you ſhall find nothing but Sows, Worms, and Vermin. Now this walking with God in your calling, will keep you from the Vermin of your callings. Yea,</p>
               <p n="5">5 Thereby ſhall your way of godlineſs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and winning. <hi>As God hath diſtributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk and abide with God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in this Chapter; Why ſo! <hi>For what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48564:43"/> thou, oh Wife, whether thou ſhalt not ſave thine Huſband;</hi> or, <hi>how knoweſt thou, oh Man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Wiſe?</hi> Yea, ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Likewiſe ye Wives be in ſubjection to your own Husbands, that if any obey not the word, they alſo without the word, may be won by the converſation of the Wives.</hi> It is not therefore a morning or evening duty, though that is good, that is ſo winning; but a conſtant walking with God in our places and callings, is convincing and winning. Yea,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thereby alſo you ſhall be fit to die, and leave all the World with eaſe. The more a man runs his heart into the world in his calling, the harder it will be to die; and the more a man walketh with God in his calling, the fitter he will be to die, and to leave all the world with eaſe. Now therefore as you do deſire, That you may be fit to die, That your ways of godlineſs may be convincing and winning, That the knots and difficulties of your callings may be taken off, That your callings may be a bleſſing to you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, And that God may meet and walk with you in your general calling, labour more and more to abide and walk with God in your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling, Which that you may do, Labour to be maſter of your Art, Be diligent in your place, Deal not unjuſtly with men in your calling, be not too familiar with your callings, but keep your due diſtance from them, Obſerve what the Temptations and Snares are, that are incident, and take heed thereof, Labour more to live by Faith in your calling, Let not your general eat up you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus Brethren, <hi>Let every one wherein he is called therein abide with God.</hi> For it is the duty of every man to abide and walk with God in his calling.

                  </gap>mination. A good man doth ponder, weigh, and examine his own doings and ways, <hi>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies, verſe</hi> 59. The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th is drawn from his readineſs to keep Gods Commandments. A good man doth not put off or delay his duty, <hi>I made haſt and delayed not to keep thy Commandments. verſe</hi> 60. The ſixth is drawn from his adhaeſion to the ways of God in times of oppoſition. A good man will not be driven from the ways of God by the oppoſition of men. <hi>The bands of the wicked have robbed me, but I have not forgotten thy law. verſe</hi> 61. The ſeventh is drawn from the thankfulneſs of his diſpoſition under all diſpenſations. A good man will give thanks to God whatever his condition be. <hi>At midnight I will give thanks unto thee, becauſe of thy righteous judgements, verſe</hi> 62. And the eighth is drawn from his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. A good man will keep company with thoſe that are good; <hi>I am a companion of all that fear thee.</hi> Which is explained by theſe following words, <hi>and of them that keep thy Precepts, I am a companion of all that fear thee.</hi> Though I be a King, and they be never ſo poor. <hi>I, ev n I,</hi> David <hi>the King, am a companion of all that fear thee, and do keep thy Precepts.</hi> Where then you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thus much, That a good man will have good company. It is the property of a good man to keep
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48564:45"/> good company, his companions are ſuch as do fear the Lord. Yea, though they be much beneath him, yet if they be ſuch as doe fear the Lord, he will not boggle at their acquaintance and fellowſhip. <hi>I am a companion</hi> (ſays <hi>David the King) of all thoſe that fear thee.</hi> So that a good man will have or keep good company. For the opening and clearing whereof, Firſt we will inquire what this good company is, and when a man may be ſaid for to keep good company. Secondly, why, and upon what account a good man will have good company. Thirdly, I will anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome Objections, or Caſes of Conſcience, about this company-keeping, and ſo come to the application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the firſt, if you ask what this good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is, I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1, That is not good company which the world calls good company, nor he a good companion which the world calls a good companion. If a man will drink and take off his Cups, he is a good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the mouth of the World. And if a man be a Jolly, Frolick, Merry man, that can make you laugh with ſome pretty Tales and Jeſts, he is a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; but if he be a good natured man, and will not be angry, then he is a good companion indeed. This is the worlds good company, or good companion, but I ſay, That is not good company which the world call good company.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is that good company which a mans own ingagements calls good company; if a man be a good man, and I have a mind to hate him, then I'le firſt ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e him wicked, that there may be room for my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; if a man be a wicked man, and I have a mind to keep him company, or love him, then I'le firſt make him good, and ſay he is good, that there may
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48564:45"/> be room for my love and fellowſhip with him. It was a cuſtome amongſt the Jews, that the King ſhould once in a year read over the chief part of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> in the Audience of the people, and as their ſtories tell us, when <hi>Agrippa</hi> came to thoſe words, <hi>One from among thy Brethren thou ſhalt ſet King over thee, thou maieſt not ſet a ſtranger over thee, which is not thy Brother. Agrippa</hi>'s eyes trickled down with tears, in remembrance that he was not of the ſeed of the Jews. Whereupon, ſaith the ſtory, the people cryed out three times, fear not <hi>Agrippa,</hi> for thou art our Brother. So that when men pleaſe they can for their own engagements make a man a Brother, and a good companion; but I ſay, That is not good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which my own judgment and engagement calls good company. But that is good company, which the Saints generally call good company, and that is good which the Scripture cals good company. <hi>Such are all thoſe that do fear the Lord, and doe keep his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> for ſo ſaith <hi>David.

               <p>Now a man is not ſaid to keep company with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either good or bad, becauſe he doth occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally fall into their ſociety. Poſſibly a good man may occaſionally meet with, or fall into the ſociety of thoſe that are wicked, Yet he is not thereby ſaid for to keep wicked company, neither is this forbidden; for ſaies the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. <hi>I have written to you that you ſhould not keep company with,</hi> &amp;c. yet not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for then you ſhould go out of the world. And poſſibly a bad man may occaſionally meet with good people, and be in their companies: yet he is not therefore ſaid to keep good company, 'tis not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48564:46"/> this or that occaſion, that doth make a companion.</p>
               <p>Neither is a companion properly one whom a man doth ordinarily deal with in a way of Trade and Commerce. For the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles time, did ordinarily trade and Commerce with the Heathens, yet did not keep company with them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion properly is ſuch an one as I do chuſe to walk and converſe with ordinarily in a way of Friendſhip; ſo that company-keeping doth imply three things, Firſt it is matter of choice, and therefore relations, as ſuch, are not properly ſaid to be our companions. 2ly, it implyes a conſtant walking and converſe with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo it is expreſſed <hi>Job.</hi> 24 8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. And Thirdly, this ordinary converſe or walking with another, muſt be in a way of friendſhip, and upon this account. <hi>He that</hi> Sampſon <hi>uſed as his friend, is called his Companion,</hi> Judges 14.20. A companion therefore properly is ſuch an one as I do chuſe to walk and converſe ordinarily with, in a way of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it by a word, that ſignifies to mingle.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>I have written to you that you keep not company with the world;</hi> the word in the Original is, that you mingle not with ſuch. There is a medling with the world, and there is a mingling with the world. It is not unlawful to meddle with the things of the world, but it is unlawful to mingle ones heart with the things of the world, ſo it is not unlawful to meddle with the perſons of the world, but to mingle with them is unlawful, and look when I do chuſe the men of the world for to walk and converſe with ordinarily, in a way of friendſhip, then do I keep them company; but if men be ſuch as fear God, and do
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48564:46"/> keep his Precepts, and I chuſe out ſuch to walk and converſe ordinarily with, then am I ſaid for to keep them company: And thus now you ſee what good company is. And when a man may be ſaid to keep bad or good company,</p>

               <p>Well, but then ſecondly, why, and upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will a good man keep good company? Why it is his duty to doe it, he cannot but do it, and it is beſt for him to do it. It is his duty: For if it be his duty to avoid evil company, then it is his duty to have good company. Now for bad company, you know what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſais, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10, <hi>If Sinners en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ye conſent thou not to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Read I pray what is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19 2 <hi>And</hi> Jehu <hi>the ſon of</hi> Hanani <hi>the</hi> Seer, <hi>went out to meet</hi> Jehoſaphat, <hi>and ſaid to him, Shouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord, therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.</hi> And ye know what is ſaid in the 1 <hi>Pſal. Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the Counſel of the ungodly, that ſtandeth not in the way of Sinners, nor ſitteth not in the ſeat of the ſcornful.</hi> It may be you will ſay that you do not ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornful, though you be amongſt them ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but do you not ſtand in the way of ſinners, nor
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48564:47"/> walk in their counſel? If you be found either in their counſel, or in their way, or in their ſeat, ſitting, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or walking amongſt them, the bleſſing doth not belong to you. If you be a Profeſſor, you ought not to be found in ſuch company. It is the duty of all thoſe that fear, to avoid evil company: and as it is their duty to avoid evil company, ſo it is their duty to frequent good company. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5 <hi>If thou knoweſt not O thou faireſt among women,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the Spouſe, <hi>Go thy way forth by the footſteps of the flock Cant.</hi> 1.8. And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> doth not only enjoyn and commend this duty, but doth encourage us unto it; for ſaith he, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhall be wiſe, but a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> So that it is a good mans duty to keep company with thoſe that are good, and as it is his duty, ſo he can do no other, his ſpiritual diſpoſition doth naturally lead him unto it. You ſay, Birds of a Feather, will together. And what is the reaſon that the Sheep doth converſe with the Sheep, and not with the Swine: That the Pidgeon doth converſe with the Pidgeon, and not with the Raven; but becauſe their diſpoſition doth naturaly lead them to converſe with thoſe that are in nature like to them. Now the divine nature of all good men is ſpiritually the ſame naturally; therefore as a good man, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but converſe and walk with thoſe that are good: And as he can do no other, ſo it is beſt for him to do ſo; for in good company there is much ſafety, as there is danger in bad, ſo in good company there is great ſafety. Our way to Heaven is a journey, and we are all travelling thither; now ye know that in a great journey, a good day, and a good way, and good company is very comfortable; ſo in our journey
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48564:47"/> to Heaven, a clear Goſpel day, a plain, even way and good company, is a great mercy, and a ſweet privilege; inſomuch as <hi>John</hi> that wrote the book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> glories in it: for I pray mark how he ſtiles himſelf. <hi>I John</hi> am the Pen-man of this Book, and would you know, ſaith he, what my title is, it is this, <hi>your Brother and Companion in Tribulation, and in the Kingdom and Patienee of Jeſus Chriſt. Rev.</hi> 1.9. It ſeems then, Firſt, That he that lies in Chriſts boſome will lie in the boſome of the Saints; of all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples it's written of <hi>John,</hi> that he was the Beloved Diſciple, that lay in Chriſts boſome: now ſays he to all the Saints. <hi>I am your Brother and Companion.</hi> Secondly, it ſeemes by this Scripture, That he that is our true companion will keep us company into tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, <hi>I am your Brother and Companion in Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> Thirdly you may here ſee, that thoſe who are the Saints companions in tribulation, ſhall be companions alſo with them in the Kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>I am your Brother and Companion in tribulation, and in the Kingdom and Patience of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That it is an honour, mercy, and a great priviledge to be a companion with the Saints, though it be in matter of tribulation, for herein doth <hi>John</hi> glory, <hi>I</hi> John, <hi>who alſo am your Brother and Companion in Tribulation;</hi> plainly then, it is a great mercy and a ſweet priviledge to have good company. But to clear up this thing to you, I ſhall only make uſe of one argument, which though one, hath many in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of it.</p>
               <p>Thus if there be much benefit to be found in good company, and much hurt and miſchief in bad compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, then it is beſt for every good man to keep good
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48564:48"/> company. Now in good company there is much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and in bad company there is much miſchief. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the benefit of good company. If in caſe you be going into evil, ready to fall into what is evil, he will put forth his hand, and will hold you from it, ſaying, <hi>Oh my friend! Do not this thing; for it is diſpleaſing unto your God, and my God.</hi> Ye know how it was with <hi>David</hi> when he was going to deſtroy <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his houſe he met with <hi>Abigail,</hi> and by her councel was diverted from it, inſomuch, as he bleſſed God for her councel. <hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.

And if ye look into, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.21. ye ſhall find, <hi>that the tongue of the righteous, is as choice Silver; the heart of the wicked is nothing worth:</hi> though he ſaith, his heart is good, and as good as any mans, though he cannot ſpeak of good a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now if the mouth of the righteous be a <hi>well of Life,</hi> and <hi>his Lips be as choice Silver, that will feed many.</hi> What a good thing is it, and profitable for a man to keep company with thoſe that are good. Yet 3dly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As good company will provoke unto what in good, ſo in caſe you fall at any time into evil, thes will ſtretch forth their hand and lift you up agaiy For ſays <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 4.9. <hi>Two are better then
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48564:49"/> one: For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but wo to him that is alone when he falleth: for he hath not another to lift him up. Again, If two lie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then have they heat; but how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail againſt him, two ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him.</hi> Are you therefore under ſome great Temptations, and do you fear that Satan will prevail againſt you, then you muſt keep good company; for <hi>if one prevail againſt him, two ſhall withſtand?</hi> Or, Is your heart grown cold and dead, then muſt you keep good company; For, <hi>If two lie together, then they have heat; but how can one be warm alone?</hi> Or, are you fallen into any ſin, then muſt you keep good company; <hi>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow?</hi> Is it not a good thing then to keep good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Surely it is, yet,</p>
               <p n="4">4. As good company will help to lift you out of the mire when you are fallen into it; So in caſe you be in any outward great ſtraight, good company will help to pull you out of that ditch, and ſtraight. For what a great ſtraight was <hi>Daniel</hi> in, when the King would put him to Death, unleſs he told him his Dream, and the meaning of it. How is it poſſible for me to know what another Dreams, yet <hi>Daniel</hi> muſt die unleſs he tell the King his Dream? Well! What doth <hi>Daniel</hi> do in this caſe, he goes up to God in his Prayers. And <hi>chap</hi> 2.17. <hi>He went to his houſe, and made the things known to</hi> Hananiah, Miſhael, <hi>and</hi> Azariah his Companions. But why did he go to them? It ſeems they were praying Companions: For ſays the Text, <hi>He told it to them, that the would deſire mercies of the God of Heaven concerning this Secret, that</hi> Daniel <hi>and his Fellows ſhould not Periſh.</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48564:49"/> Well, and what then? Then (verſe the next) <hi>was the Secret revealed unto</hi> Daniel. Suppoſe <hi>Daniels</hi> Companions had been drunken, wicked Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what help could he have had from them? But they were praying Companions, and a praying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion is a great help in the time of ſtraight. And,</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the 5th place, As good company is a great help to a man in the day of his ſtraights, ſo it is a continual bleſſing. For ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. <hi>Behold, how good and pleaſant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in unity; it is like the precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Head,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>'Tis as the dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>&amp;c. For there the Lord commandeth his bleſſing, and life for evermore.</hi> It is not barely ſaid, That there God bleſſeth, or doth pronounce a bleſſing, but <hi>there he commands his bleſſing;</hi> makes it effectual, <hi>there he commands his bleſſing.</hi> Was not <hi>Labans</hi> houſe bleſſed with the company of <hi>Jacob?</hi> Was not <hi>Potiphars</hi> houſe bleſſed with the company of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Surely where good company is, there is Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; yea, <hi>There he commandeth his bleſſing, and life for evermore.</hi> It is recorded of one Heathen, that when he would ſet his Houſe and Land to Sale, he cauſed the Cryer to proclaim, <hi>Bonum habet vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> Thinking that it would ſell the better for a good Neighbour; and ſurely a good Neighbour is a good commodity; and good company is a great mercy. <hi>There the Lord commandeth his bleſſing, and life for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. As for the miſchief of bad company, there is much miſchief to be found therein. For as good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You ſee how it is with Diſeaſes, though a man have an infectious diſeaſe yet if I keep at a diſtance from his Breath, and the like I am not infected therewith; but if I come near him to ſuck in his breath, then I am infected.

Were not the <hi>Jews</hi> infected with the ſuperſtition of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by their converſing with them? Had not <hi>Joſeph</hi> learned to ſwear by the life of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> by being in his houſe? Was not <hi>Peter</hi> infected in the <hi>High prieſts Hall,</hi> by his converſe with them? Did not <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cry out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone; becauſe I am a man of unclean lips? For I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips.</hi> It may be you think that they ſhall not infect you with their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or their practices. But they do inſenſibly infect. Evil company doth inſenſibly infect a man with Evil. You ſee how it is with a white Loaf that is ſet into the Oven, and doth ſtand neer the brown Bread, it comes out with a black patch on the ſide thereof. And ye have heard what he ſaid that went thrice to <hi>Rome,</hi> the firſt time ſaid he, <hi>I ſaw your faſhions and manners;</hi> the ſecond time, <hi>I learned them;</hi> and the third time, <hi>I brought them away.</hi> So the firſt time you go into evil company, you ſee their faſhions, and hear their
<q>Qui ſemel it Romam, videre ſcelestum; qui ſecundo, cognoſcere, qui tertio, in patriam referre. <hi>Cluveri Hiſtor. mundi.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>p. 687.</hi>

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48564:51"/> words; the ſecond time ye learn them; and the third time you bring them away. And will you ſay, No, I have been often in ſuch company, yet I have not brought their faſhions and manners away? then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Evil communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions corrupts good manners.</hi> And have you not brought a black patch away with you? It may be others ſee it, though you your ſelf do not; I believe the word of God rather then your word, <hi>Evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications doth corrupt good manners.</hi> It will infect your Judgment before you are aware; and your Practice before you are aware: for evil company is infecting company. And in the third place,</p>
               <p n="3">3. As they do inſenſibly infect a man with what is evil, ſo they do by your company with them, draw you into the fellowſhip and communion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. For there are two great Princes in the world, Chriſt and the Devil, and Chriſt ruleth in the children of Obedience; and thoſe that have communion with them, have thereby communion with Chriſt: So Satan ruleth in the the children of Diſobedience; and thoſe that have fellowſhip and communion with them have thereby communion with Satan. For how can a man have communion with the Members, and not with the Head? Now is it not a great evil and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to have communion and fellowſhip with Satan? This you have that keep company with wicked Men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if you have communion with Satan and his Members here, then you ſhall have communion with him and his Members hereafter. There is a draught of things to come in this life. Thoſe that ſtand at the right hand of Chriſt here, ſhall ſtand
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48564:51"/> at his right hand in the day of Judgment. And thoſe that ſtand on his left hand here, ſhall ſtand on his left hand at the day of Judgment. So thoſe that are bound up with the wicked here, ſhall be bound up with them hereafter. There is a bundle of Life, and there is a bundle of Death. Some men there are that ſhall be bound up in the bundle of Life; and ſome men there are that ſhall be bound up in the bundle of Death. <hi>Take them and bind them hands and foot, and caſt them into outward darkneſs,</hi> ſai h Chriſt. Here is a company of Drunkards, bind them together, and caſt them into Hell for ever; Here is a company of Swearers, and there a company of Oppoſers, and Jearers, and there a company of unclean perſons, and there a company of more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral civil men. Take them and bind them up as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Faggots, and caſt them into that fire that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quenched. And I pray tell me, Who do you think ſhall be bound up with theſe? Shall not thoſe that bundle up themſelves with them now? That keep company with them now? <hi>Come out of her my People,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>leſt you partake with her in her Plagues.</hi> They that will partake with wicked men in their company now, ſhall partake with them in their plagues hereafter. And,</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the preſent, what ſhall you get by all your wicked company, but a reproch and a blot that ſhall not be wiped off. Doth not the mingling of the Water with the Wine, alter the colour of the Wine? So ſhall your mingling with evil company do; it ſhall not onely abate of your ſtrength unto what is good, but it ſhall alter the colour of your profeſſion. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>It ſhall be a ſnare upon you,</hi> Prov. 22.24, 25. <hi>Make no friendſhip with an angry man, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48564:52"/> with a furious man thou ſhalt not go, leaſt thou learn his ways, and get a ſnare unto thy Soul</hi> What will not a wicked man think of himſelf, when you that are godly ſhall keep company with him? Will not he ſay, if my condition were not good, and if I were not godly, this man or woman would not keep company with me? Thus you harden and offend him by your company with him; and who among the Saints is not offended at your walking and converſing &amp; keeping company with ſuch men. Now is it nothing in your eye to offend the generation of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the Unrighteous too? Yet this do you do, that are profeſſors of the Goſpel, by your company with thoſe that are evil. Yet, this is not all, but as you offend the godly and the wicked, ſo you offend God himſelf: For the more you converſe with wicked men, the leſs you converſe with God, and God with you; the more you turn in to them, the more God will turn from you; the more ſociety you have with the world, the leſs acquaintance you ſhall have with God. God is offended in a way of Anger; the Saints in a way of Grief; and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a way of Stumbling, by your keeping company with them. Oh what an evil thing therefore is it to keep company with thoſe that are bad! And thus ye ſee the miſchief of evil company. Now if there is ſo much benefit in good company, and ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in evil company; then it is, and muſt be beſt for every good man, to keep good company. But as ye have heard there is much benefit in good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and much miſchief in bad company; ſurely therefore it is beſt for every good man to keep good company. It is his duty to do. He can do no other but do it. And its beſt for him to do ſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48564:52"/> a good man will have good company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. But though a good man will have good company; yet, whether is it not lawful in ſome caſes to keep evil company?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ye have heard, and ſeen, and read what the Scripture ſaith in this caſe; and the Scripture onely is the rule of lawful and unlawful things. And pray do but mark what ſtreſs the Scripture lays upon this prohibition, and how it loads it with variety of expreſſions. Will ye inſtance in the perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, then it forbids your company with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>ſinners and ſcorners.</hi> In the firſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> Vain perſons that have no good will, are meerly vain, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers, evil and wicked doers. In <hi>Pſalm</hi> 26.4, 5. <hi>I have not ſate with vain perſons, neither will I go in with diſſemblers. I hate the Congregation of evil doers, and I will not ſit with the wicked.</hi> And what can be ſaid more to delineate and characterize the perſons themſelves, whoſe company you are to avoid. Or will ye inſtance in the actions of keeping compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Mark how the Scripture loads this prohibition in that reſpect. Here the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>I have not ſate with them, neither will I go in with them.</hi> If they will go into an Ale-houſe, or elſewhere, I <hi>will not go in with them, I will not ſit with them,</hi> neither will I <hi>go in with them.</hi> And in the firſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> there are three terms, <hi>ſtanding, ſitting, and walking. Bleſſed is the man that ſtandeth not, ſitteth not, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with them.</hi> And in that 4th of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> there are no leſs then four expreſſions put together upon this prohibition in one verſe; at the 14. he ſaith, <hi>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men;</hi> then <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>avoid it;</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48564:53"/> there's one expreſſion; <hi>Paſſe by it,</hi> there's another; <hi>Turn from it,</hi> there's another; and <hi>Paſs away,</hi> there's another. Now if you will break through this hedge of expreſſions with ſome diſtinctions, take heed how you diſtinguiſh over and againſt the letter of the Scripture that is ſo full, leſt a Serpent bite you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Why, but if it be unlawful for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the Goſpel to keep bad company; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may it ſtand with Grace ſo to do? Suppoſe I do keep bad company, and ſuppoſe it be unlawful ſo to do; whether is it ſuch an evil as cannot ſtand with Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, That it is in this ſin as in all other ſins: Now ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not;</hi> that is, He doth not ſo lie in his ſin, but he purgeth it out; <hi>For he that hath this hope,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>purgeth himſelf,</hi> [elſe he were of the Devil, ſaith he, who ſins, and does not purge out his ſin] but as the fountain or ſpring purgeth out the dirt that doth fall into it; ſo <hi>he that is born of God ſinneth not,</hi> but he doth purge it out: And ſo in this caſe, as a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48564:53"/> good man may fall into another ſin, ſo he may fall into this ſin of evil company; but if a Profeſſor be convinced of the evil of it, and doth not leave his evil company, and purge himſelf from it, then he is not born of God; thus it can no more ſtand with Grace, then another ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Why? but if it be unlawful to keep evil company, and it be our duty to keep good company, yea, to keep company with all thoſe that do fear the Lord; then, Whether is it lawful to keep company with erroneous perſons? For <hi>David</hi> ſaith here, <hi>I am a companion of all thoſe that do fear thee.</hi> Now ſo it is, that ſome that fear God have fallen into errours; whether may I therefore keep company with them? For anſwer:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ordinarily ſaid, That a man muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his own weakneſs, and their ſtrength that are erroneous: If I will mingle a ſpoonful of Wine with a pailfull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Water, ſhall I not loſe the Wine? For ſo ſay ſome, If I am but weak in knowledge, and will go and mingle my ſelf with them that are ſtrong in errours, what ſhall I do but loſe my own knowledge? But there are two or three things that I ſhall ſpeak to in this caſe of Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ye muſt know, That there are ſome errours that are leſs; ſome that are ſo groſs, that do manifeſt a wicked ſtate and condition in them that hold them: They are called <hi>errours of the wicked,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.17. Now though I may ſometimes converſe with thoſe that are leſs erroneous; yet if their errours be ſuch, as cannot ſtand with Grace, the Goſpel, or the power of Godlineſs, then I am to ſhun their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48564:54"/> as much as the company of a Drunkard, Swearer, or Unclean Perſon. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, You muſt obſerve all this verſe, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth not barely ſay, <hi>I am a Companion of all that fear thee,</hi> but he explains who thoſe are that do fear the Lord, and ſuch as keep his Precepts; now men that depart from his ordinances do not keep his Precepts; and therefore though in regard of their other profeſſion, they may ſeem for to fear the Lord, yet if they do not keep his Precepts, this Scripture doth not warrant me to be their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And in the third place,</p>
               <p n="3">3. You know and muſt remember what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>If any one that is called a Brother, does walk inordinately, from ſuch turn away and avoid them.</hi> So that though I muſt keep company with thoſe that fear the Lord, while they ſtand right; yet if they do not ſtand right but do walk diſorderly, then I am commanded by another Scripture to avoid them for a while, that they may be aſhamed. And thus now I have anſwered to thoſe ſeveral Caſes of Conſcience, and have cleared the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Application.</label>
               </p>
               <p>Now by way of Application, if a good man will keep good company, then what ſhall we think of thoſe that never kept good company all their dayes? 20, 30, 40, years old, yet never kept good co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48564:54"/> but they have not choſen the company of ſuch as do fear the Lord, and keep his precepts. Now if a good man will keep go d company, what ſhall we think of thoſe that never kept good company all their time? Yea, what ſhall we think of thoſe that have kept, and doe keep bad company? Every man is as his company is. The Heathen co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is known by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that cannot be known by himſelf. A mans company is a Commentary upon his Life, thereby you may underſtand a man though he be never ſo cloſe and myſtical. Its recorded of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> that he came thus to know his Daughters inclinations; for being once at a publick ſhew, where much people were preſent, he obſerved that the Grave <hi>Senators</hi> talked with <hi>Livia,</hi> but looſe youngſters, and riotous perſons with <hi>Julia,</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he concluded, that the one w s grave, and the other light and vain. And if ye look into the 50 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ye ſhall find that God doth conclude a man to be a wicked man, by his converſe, and partaking with thoſe that are wicked, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>But to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my Covenant in thy mouth?</hi> Doſt thou come to the ordinance, and doſt thou ſpeak of the Covenant of Grace? Theſe do not belong to thee; Why? For thou hateſt inſtruction and caſteſt my words behind thee: For when thou ſaweſt a Thief, then thou conſentedſt with him, and haſt been partaker with the Adulterers. O what a ſad condition therefore are all thoſe in that do keep bad
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48564:55"/> com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany; God looks upon them as wicked, that doe keep company with the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Why, but is it not better to keep bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany then none? It is not good for man to be alone, that is uncomfortable, is it not therefore better to have bad company then none?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No. For ſuppoſe you were to go a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whether would you chuſe to ride alone, or in the company of Thieves? Would you not rather chuſe to ride alone, though it be uncomfortable, then in the company of Thieves? Surely ye would. Why, ſuch are all wicked company, <hi>Amici temporis fures,</hi> Friends are thieves of time, eſpecially wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friends; for they will not only rob you of your precious time, but of your precious duties, principles, and graces, Or! pray tell me, which is worſt, ſin or ſorrow? Poſſibly it may be your affliction and ſorrow to walk alone, but to keep bad company is your ſin and guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why? but are they all alike guilty that do keep bad company?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No. For there are three ſorts of men, that do or may poſſibly keep bad company. Some are wicked themſelves, ſome are Profeſſors, and ſome Members of Churches. It ill for a wicked man to keep bad company, it is worſe for a Profeſſor of the Goſpel, but its worſt of all for a Member of a Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its ill for any man to keep evil company, it is ill for a wicked man himſelf to do it; for the more companions that a man hath in his wickedneſs, the more he is incloſed therein, and the harder it is for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48564:55"/> him to break away from his wickedneſs. Is it not an hard thing for a Bird to flie away that is taken in the Lime twiggs? Why? evill company is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils lime-twiggs; and what is the reaſon that many a man doth continue in his ſin, who is convinced of the evil of it? but becauſe he is held faſt in the bands of his wicked company. O ſaith one, I confeſs it is my duty to live otherwiſe, but I cannot get away from my company, ſo that though a man be a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man himſelf, it is an evil thing for him to keep bad company. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, As it is an evil thing for a wicked man to keep bad company, ſo it is worſer for a Profeſſor of the Goſpel to do it. <hi>Peccatum majus.</hi> The more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy there is between the ſin and the ſinner, the worſer and the greater is the ſin. Now a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Goſpel is ſuch an one as hath Dedicated himſelf unto God, and ſeparated himſelf from the world; and therefore for him to keep ill company, is directly contrary unto his profeſſion; the more that any man ſins againſt his knowledge and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the greater is his ſin, ſuch a ſin is called Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>And Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft.</hi> Now what Profeſſor is there of the Goſpel, but doth know that he ought to avoid evil company? Poſsibly a poor, ignorant, prophane man, may not know his duty in this caſe, but a Profeſſor knows his duty; and therefore as it is evil in any man to keep bad company, ſo it is worſer for a Profeſſor of the Goſpel to do it. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the third place, it is worſt of all in a Member of a Church, for he ſins againſt his preſent Remedy. Sins againſt Remedy are the worſt ſort of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48564:56"/> ſins. It is a grievous ſin for any Young unmarried man to commit Fornication; but if a man be married and doth commit Adultery, he ſins worſe; why? becauſe he ſins againſt remedy, and becauſe he hath a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by him. So here it is ill for any man to keep ill company, but worſt for a Member of a Church; Why? Becauſe he ſins againſt a Remedy; he hath Communion with the Saints; he hath good company by him, a remedy by him, and therefore for him to keep bad company is the worſt of all; the more any man deſpiſes the ways and ordinances of God by his ſin, the greater is his ſin. Now if you look into Scripture ye ſhall find, that when a man hath two things before him, &amp; doth chuſe the one, and refuſe the other, look what that is that he leaveth, that he is ſaid to hate and deſpiſe. Now a Member of a Church hath two ſorts of companies before him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he ſhall chuſe to walk with thoſe that are evil, he is ſaid in Scripture language to hate and deſpiſe the company of the Saints; and is it a ſmall thing in your eyes to hate or deſpiſe the Company and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Saints?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Why, but though I do keep company ſometimes with thoſe that are wicked, yet I do not deſpiſe or hate the company of the Saints, for I keep company with them too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That's ſtrange, Strange in regard of your ſelf, Strange in regard of others. Strange in regard of your ſelf; for if you find any ſavour in good company, is it not ſtrange that you ſhould not refrain bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; ſurely good company will either eat out the heart of your bad company, or bad company will eat out the ſavour of your good company. Strange
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48564:56"/> therefore it is, if you ſhould keep both companies; ſtrange in regard of your ſelf, and ſtrange alſo it is in regard of others. When the Deer is ſhot, the reſt of that Herd will puſh him out from amongſt them: and if you be ſhot with the Arrow of bad company, 'tis ſtrange that the reſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f your Herd ſhould not puſh you out of their ſociety, and avoid you, becauſe you will not avoid others. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, You ſay that you keep company with the good too, but I pray tell me, is it not the Mud of the good company that you converſe withal? As in a River or Pond, there is Water and Mudd; ſo in all good company, there is the Water of Life, and there is the Mud of their Infirmities and Vanities; if it be the Mud of good company that you converſe with, then do you keep bad company, even whileſt you converſe with thoſe that are good. But,</p>
               <p>Again Thirdly, You ſay you keep company with both good and bad, bad and good. But who art thou that doſt ſo? I read in the old Teſtament, that thoſe creatures which live both in the land and in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were counted unclean. I read alſo in Scripture of a ſincere Chriſtian, and a Luke-warm Profeſſor; and what is lukewarm water, but that water which hath both heat and cold in ſome equal degrees? and what is the lukewarm Profeſſor, but one that can run with both, and comply with both companies. I read in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. That God compared the declining people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto a Cake dough-baked, baked on the one ſide and not on the other. Why? But becauſe they were for God and Idolls too; They could walk and converſe with both. So now when men are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48564:57"/> for both companies, they can ſtand with the Saint, and they can ſtand with Sinners, they can ſit with the Scornful, and they can ſit with the Faithful, they can go in and out with Gods people, and they can go in and out with the wicked. What doth this argue, but that they are dough-baked, and lukewarm Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors?</p>
               <p>Yet fourthly, if there be any ſuch amongſt us (which God forbid) give me leave to ſpeak three or four words unto them. You ſay you can walk with both good and bad; but what comfort can you have in walking at all with thoſe that are bad. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> ſaid once, there are two queſtions which if a man can rightly anſwer he may have comfort in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt queſtion is, <hi>What am I?</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion is. <hi>Where am I?</hi> If ſaid he, in anſwer to the firſt, <hi>What am I?</hi> I can truly ſay I am Godly, I am in Chriſt, I am one of thoſe that <hi>fear the Lord in truth.</hi> And if in anſwer to the ſecond, <hi>Where am I?</hi> I can ſay I am in my calling, I am on Gods ground, I am where God would have me be, then I may have comfort in every condition. But if you that are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel be in company with the wicked, can you ſay, I am where God would have me be, I am on Gods ground; ſurely no. What comfort therefore can you have in walking with ſuch compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at all? But ſecondly, do you not know that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed company lye in wait for your halting, and deſire your falling. Mark what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.6. <hi>And if he come to ſee me, he ſpeaketh vanity, his heart gathereth iniquity to it ſelf, and when he goeth abroad he telleth it.</hi> And mark what his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. <hi>Enter not into the Path of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48564:57"/> Wicked, Avoid it, Paſs not by it,</hi> Why? <hi>For they ſleep not unleſs they have done miſchiefe, and their ſleep is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, unleſs they cauſe ſome to fall.</hi> It may be you think they love your perſon, but do they not hate your way more then they love your perſon, and will you walk with them that hate your way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you think they love your perſon; Be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Do you not know thirdly, That in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they will thruſt you into danger, that they may ſave themſelves out of danger. There was a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency between good <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> and wicked <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab;</hi> and when they went into the Field, what did <hi>Ahab</hi> ſay to <hi>Jehoſaphat?</hi> Read what he ſaid and did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.29 <hi>I will diſguiſe my ſelf, and will go to the Battel, but put thou on thy Robes;</hi> but ſee the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of it, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. Plainly ſhewing thus much, that if a good man hold correſpondency with a wicked man, in caſe there be any danger, the wicked will thruſt the good man into danger, to keep himſelf out. But in the fourth place, if you have not conſidered this Scripture before, yet have you not thought on that Scripture, <hi>As for thoſe that turn aſide by crooked paths, the Lord will lead them forth with the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Now is not this a crooked path to walk with both companies, with the godly in the light, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he wicked in the dark. Well, Wo be to him that doth ſo, God will in due time diſcover him, and lead him forth with the workers of iniquity, Oh what an evil thing therefore is it to halt between two, to walk and keep company with both good and bad, bad and good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Why, But I praiſe God; will ſome ſay, I do not keep company with the Wicked at all, ſo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48564:58"/> as to walk and converſe with them ordinarily in a way of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is well, But what if God will count vain company in the number of bad company? For ye have it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.4. Secondly, what if God will account thoſe for your companions whom you would be with, if you were not reſtrained by the fear and ſhame of your friends. We find in Scripture, that a man is ſaid to do all that which he would do, if he were not reſtrained. <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to ſacrifice his Son, becauſe he would have done it, if God had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him, ſo look what that company is, that I would be with, if I were not reſtrained; that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny according to Scripture, I am ſaid to keep. Thirdly, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t if God will account all thoſe for your companions whom you juſtifie, like, or conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the way of your ſin and vanity? So ye read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.20. Or what if God will account your compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to your ſervants of choice, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>that he would not know a wicked perſon.</hi> Mark how he proves it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.4. he ſaith, <hi>A froward heart ſhall depart from me, I will not know a wicked perſon,</hi> but ſays he, <hi>verſe</hi> 6 <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithful in the Land, that they may dwell with me, he that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me; he that worketh deceit ſhall not dwell within my houſe, and he that telleth lyes ſhall not tarry in my ſight, verſe</hi> 7, it is ordinarily ſaid, <hi>Servi ſunt humiles amici, Your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are your loweſt friends;</hi> and though a mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are not properly his companions, yet his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions may be known by his ſervants of choiſe. Poſſibly a man cannot get a godly ſervant, but if a man have godly and ungodly before him, and ſhall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48564:58"/> chuſe ſuch as are vain or wicked, this argues what his company would be if he had his choice and his mind. Now God can turn up all our leaves and ſee what grows under them. And if all theſe things be true, how few are there that will ſtand free from wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly company. But my Beloved, either there is comfort enough to be ſound in good company, or there is not; if there, be not enough in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, why ſhould you converſe with them at all, and if there be comfort enough in thoſe that are good, why ſhould you not walk with them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest</hi> But what ſhall we then do, that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void evil company, that we may choſe good company and improve them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here are three queſtions I ſhall ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto them diſtinctly. As for the firſt, Do you ask what you ſhall do that you may avoid evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Firſt, you muſt be ſure to mortifie your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, inclination, and diſpoſition to the vanity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; 'tis not the perſwaſions of evil company that doth lead you to them, but it is your own diſpoſition and unmortified affections; you think it may be, that it is their Spark that doth ſet you a fire, but it is your Tinder that doth cloſe with their ſpark, if there were but Water thrown on your own Tinder you could not be ſo fired with your evil company. <hi>The Woman that thou gaveſt me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Adam, did give me to eat,</hi> and ſo I was drawn into this ſin, but it was his own diſpoſition that did lead him to it, 'tis in this ſin as in all other outward ſins; 'tis not the drink or wine that is in fault, but a mans own drunken diſpoſition that doth lead him to drunkenneſs; 'tis not the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48564:59"/> object thas is in fault, but a mans own wanton diſpoſition that doth lead him into uncleanneſs; ſo here it is not your company, but your own diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that doth lead you into it. Would you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore avoid and abſtain from your wanton company then labour to mortifie your own wanton affections, would you abſtain from and avoid your vain compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; then muſt you firſt labour to mortifie the vanity of your own heart and ſpirit; otherwiſe though you abſtain from your company for a time, yet you will return again. Firſt therefore mortifie your own luſts and earthly affections</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the ſecond place, Be ſure that you avoid all thoſe occaſions, which though lawful in themſelves, yet through your weakneſs may any way open a door un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evil company, when the <hi>Nazarites</hi> were forbidden wine, they were forbidden grapes alſo, whereof wine was made. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.3. And if ye look again into the fourth of the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> you ſhall find that when the Holy Ghoſt by <hi>Solomon</hi> doth forbid <hi>you to enter into the Path of the wicked, and going in the way of evil men;</hi> he doth in the name of God command you to <hi>avoid it, not to paſs by it, to turn from it, and to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, verſe</hi> 15. as if ſays Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> A Phyſitian ſhould give directions to a man to avoid the Plague; the great Receipt ſaith he, that the Phyſitian gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Plague, is made of three Ingredients, <hi>Citò, Longè, Tardè,</hi> Fly quickly, Remove far from the place, and Return ſlowly; ſo here ſaith he, as if there were a Plague in evil company, The Holy Ghoſt bids us to depart quickly, and not to come near, and what is the reaſon that many are ſo overtaken with evil company, but becauſe they do not avoid all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48564:59"/> thoſe lawful occaſions; which through your own weakneſs doth lead them into it; be ſure therefore that you avoid them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And in the third place, if you would avoid evil company, then you muſt part abruptly with them, you think thus it may be, though I part with my evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, yet I will part civilly with them, I will go but once more, and again, I will go but once more to them, and will part fairly, with them. Whereas our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>if thy right eye offend thee pull it out, &amp; if thy right hand offend thee cut it off.</hi> Look what that is, that is near and dear to you, That muſt you part with in a way of violence? if you will part fairly with your company, then go to them and ſay, Well I have ſinned, and ſinned greatly in keeping your company; Now God through Grace hath convinced me of it, I will never come in your company in any ſuch way again, and he that will part with wicked company muſt be abrupt in his parting with them. That's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he third thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And in the Fourth place, If you would avoid and part with your evil company, then you muſt humble your ſelf before the Lord, for all the vanity and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of your Company-keeping; ſome men being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their ſin in Company-keeping, do reſolve ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to come in ſuch company again: And it may be they do refrain for three or four weeks, but in a ſhort time they are where they were. And what's the reaſon, that though men be convinced of their ſin, yet they return again? but becauſe they go forth in the ſtrength of their own reſolutions, and were never throughly humbled for their ſin. Would you therefore ſo refrain from evil company, that you
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48564:60"/> may return no more; then go and humble your ſelf before the Lord for the evil of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And in the fifth place, Be ſure that you do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Saints to that is good for their multitude: for he that follows the multitude to good, becauſe they are many, will alſo follow the multitude unto what is evil, <hi>Non faeciendum,</hi> &amp;c ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non faciendum, quia multi faciunt ſed quia bonum ut bonum faciunt, aut bene ſatis mihi ſunt pauci, ſatis unus, ſatis nullus: <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Si potentiores faciunt, non faciam quia faciunt, ſed gaudeo quia faciunt.</note> we muſt not do a good thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many do it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is good; if others do that which is good ſaith he, I will rejoyce becauſe they do it, but I will not do it, becauſe they do it that I may do good; for to do well few ſhall ſuffice, yea one, yea none. The way to follow the multitude to evil, is to follow the multitude to good; becauſe of this multitude take heed therefore of that</p>
               <p>Sixthly. And if you would avoid evil company, Then be ſure that you keep good company, and improve them. <hi>Intus exiſtens prohibet alienum.</hi> If the Veſſel be full of Wine, it keeps out Air and Water; good thoughts keep out bad thought, good words keep out bad words, and good company keeps out bad company. And what is the reaſon that many poor ſouls are led away with naughty and debauched company, but becauſe they are not hedged in with good company; for as bad company keeps men from good company, ſo good company will keep men from bad company. Look what day or time that is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you depart from good, then are you expoſed unto them that are evil; yet it is not enough to have good
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48564:60"/> company, but you muſt improve alſo, and gain by them; for if you be in good, company, and do get nothing by them, you will ſay, What need I make ſuch a ſtir about my company, I ſee no difference; As one company talks of the world, ſo doth the other alſo; and as I get nothing by the one, ſo I get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the other alſo; therefore I'le return unto my old company again? Would ye therefore avoid evil c mpany, then be ſure that you keep good company, and improve them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt</hi> 2 Why? but I do not know how to chuſe good company: I confeſs good company is a great mercy, and bad company is a great miſery, but how ſhall be able to chuſe my company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You muſt go to God and beſeech him for to chuſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our company for you: Mark what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid and did; in this Scripture he ſaith, <hi>I am a companion of all thoſe that do fear the Lord;</hi> yet <hi>ver.</hi> 79. he goes to God, and prayeth, ſaying, <hi>Let thoſe that fear thee, O Lord, turn unto me, and thoſe that have known thy teſtimonies.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Of a truth, Lord I am a companion of all that do fear thee; but it is not in my power to bend their hearts unto me; the hearts of all men are in thy hands, now therefore <hi>let thoſe that fear thee turn unto me.</hi> So do you go to God, and ſay likewiſe, Lord, do thou chuſe my company for me, let thoſe that fear thee turn in unto me: O do thou bowe and incline their hearts to be my companions.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. If you would act herein under God, and make a right choice of your company, then muſt you get your nature changed. The Raven keeps company with the Ravens, and not with the Pigeons;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48564:61"/> but if the nature of the Raven were changed into the nature of a Pigeon, it would flock together with the Pigeons. Every thing follows its nature. Labour therefore to get your nature changed; and then though you have flown with the Ravens, you will flock together with Gods Doves.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. And in the third place, if you would make a right choice of your company, then you muſt get a diſcerning ſpirit, that you may be able to put a difference between thoſe that fear the Lord, and thoſe that fear him not; between thoſe that are civil, moral men, and thoſe that that are gracious. <hi>The ſpiritual man judgeth all things.</hi> And what is the reaſon that people keep no better company, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot diſcern of company? And what is the reaſon that they diſcern not between company and company, but becauſe they are not ſpiritual? Would ye therefore be able to make a right choice of your company? then get this diſcerning ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. And in the fourth place obſerve, Who thoſe are that are moſt profitable in your ſociety; who thoſe are that are moſt ſound in their faith, ſavoury in their ſpirits, and moſt communicative and profitable in their lives, and with ſuch cloſe; Some have knowledge enough to diſcourſe with, but they have no ſavour in their ſpirits: Some are of a ſavoury ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but they want knowledge, and are not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative; but let thoſe <hi>that fear thee turn unto me, and thoſe that have known thy teſtimonies,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, I would not only have knowing men to be my companions, but fearing men. Neither would I only keep company with <hi>thoſe that fear thee,</hi> but with ſuch as are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48564:61"/> and do <hi>know thy teſtimonies.</hi> Thus let his choice be yours, a knowing man, and a fearing man, a fearing man, and a knowing man, will make a meet companion for you.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. And if you would make a good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable choice of your company, then in caſe you be a man, Let the friend of your boſome be a man, and not a woman, unleſs it be your Wife; and if you be a woman, then let the friend of your boſome be a woman, and not a man, unleſs it be your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; for if the ſpecial friendſhip be between a man and a woman, who knows how ſoon the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual friendſhip may degenerate into carnal affection; and if it may be, let your friend or companion ſtand upon even ground and a level with you; for the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Proverb is often true, <hi>He that will eat Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with Noblemen, ſhall have his eyes ſpirt out with the ſtones thereof.</hi> Therefore affect not company too high for you. But whatever degree your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany be of, be ſure that it be not ſuch as will be apt to take an offence from you, nor ſuch as you ſhall be apt to take an offence from; for then your ſociety will always be uncomfortable. Thus do, and your choice ſhall be right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Well, but ſuppoſe I have choſen good company, and I can ſay in truth with <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>I am a companion of all thoſe that do fear thee, and do keep thy precepts;</hi> What ſhall I do, that I may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my company? I praiſe God I have good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but I do not know how to improve them; what ſhall I therefore do that I may improve my good company?</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:48564:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, You muſt be humbled for all the miſpence of your time with good company. The way to improve a mercy, is to be humbled for our not improvement of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would improve your good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Then lay your right ends together when you meet; you ſee how it is with a fire that is half burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if you would mend it, you take the ſticks and lay them together; but then you do not lay the cold ends together, but the hot ends together. Now there is no company ſo good, but hath its cold ends, and its warm ends; if you lay your cold ends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when ye meet, what heat, what warmth, what good or improvement can you expect? Therefore lay your warm ends together when you meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obſerve what that grace is wherein your companions doth excell, and labour more and more for to draw that forth; every Saint and Godly man doth not excell in every grace. <hi>Non omnis fert omnia tellus,</hi> Every ground will not bear Wheat or Rye, but ſome one Grain, and ſome another; ſo every Chriſtian doth not excell in every grace, ſome in one grace, and ſome in another: It may be he hath life, and you have light; or it may be he hath light, and you have life: And why hath God given this to one, and that to another? But that they may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding one to another, and have communion one with another. Would ye therefore improve your communion and good company, Then obſerve what that grace is wherein he doth moſt excell, and labour more and more to draw out the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:48564:62"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Take heed alſo of pride and envy, which is the bane of all good company: Pride will make a man ſpeak, and pride will make a man hold his peace. I am a poor ignorant man or woman, ſaith one, and therefore I will not ſpeak of that which is good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their company; yet this may be out of pride. I have an opportunity of doing good in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſaith another, and therefore I'le ſpeak, yet this may be out of pride too. There was ſuch an one ſpake good words at ſuch a time, ſaith another, but 'twas little to the purpoſe, and this may be out of envy: Now envy is between equals, and pride between unequals; either therefore you converſe with your equals, or with your unequals; if with your equals, take heed of envy; if with your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equals, take heed of pride.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And in the fifth place, If you would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your good company, and profit by them, then pray over them, and for them. Of all companies, ſays Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> I never profited and gained more by any, then by thoſe that I prayed moſt for; and what is the reaſon that you profit no more by your good company, but becauſe you pray no more for them, and over them. You will pray over your hearing, reading, or meditation; why? becauſe it is an Ordinance: So is this of good company too. And therefore if you would improve and profit by your company, then pray much over them, and for them: Yet</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Do not reſt ſecure in your good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for though you be in a good company, you may poſſibly get more hurt then if you had been in bad company. And what is the reaſon that you
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48564:63"/> come ſometimes from bad company, into which you have been caſt occaſionally, or againſt your will, with your ſoul troubled for their ſin, and through Gods providence do get good thereby: And you come from good company with your heart flat, and dead, and dull, but becauſe you reſt ſecure in your good company? In the one you watch, in the other not. Wherefore reſt not ſecure in your company, though it be ne're ſo good: Good company is Gods Ordinance, but it is an Ordinance that doth tend unto other Ordinances: Some Ordinances tend unto other Ordinances. It is an Ordinance that we ſhould reſt on the Sabbath-day. But why are we to reſt then? for reſt ſake? No, but we are to reſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the poſitive ſanctification of the Sabbath; ſo we are to keep good company, but why? What for it ſelf? No, but in order to other Duties. Now if it be an Ordinance that lyes in order to other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, why ſhould we reſt in it? The more you reſt in it, the leſs you will improve it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not reſt ſecure in your company, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ne're ſo good. But be ſure that you look upon it as a Duty in order to other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and thus you ſhall improve it. Which that you may do,</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Conſider with your ſelf what a great Talent is put into your hand, when you are betruſted with good company; thereby you have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of gaining ſomething which you cannot gain by your publick Miniſtery. You ſee how it is with the Candle. I can take a Candle in my hand, and go down into the Cellar, and ſee that thereby, which I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48564:63"/> cannot ſee by the light of the Sun; poſſibly the Sun-beams may not reach that which the beams of the Candle may reach: So poſſibly the light and beams of private Communion, may reach that truth which the beams of the publick Miniſtery doth not reach. 'Tis poſſible that a Miniſter may ſpeak to a truth in publick, yet he may leave it in the dark; when I come at home, then I may beat it out more fully with good company. So that this Ordinance of good company is a great Talent; and will the Lord require an account of the improvement of our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, then ſurely he will have an account of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Company. In the third of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Then thoſe that feared the Lord ſpake often, and a book of rememembrance was written.</hi> God hath a Table-book at work upon all our ſpeeches and conferences when we meet together, and he ſets down what we ſay, and what we do when we meet together; and ſhall we not then take heed what company we come in, and what we do and ſpeak in our company? It's recorded of Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, That though he was ſomewhat free in his ſpeech when he was examined, yet when he heard a Pen writing behind the Curtain, then he was more wary. Why! believe it, there is a Pen behind the Curtain, that ſets down what you do, and ſay in your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whether good or bad. Now therefore, as ever you do deſire that Gods own Hand-writing, that Gods own Table-book may not be brought out againſt you, take heed what company you come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and what you do and ſpeak in your company: Thus ſhall you be able to avoid bad company, to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48564:64"/> chuſe good, and to improve the ſame. And thus now I have done with this Argument of good company. A good man will have good company; <hi>For I am a companion,</hi> ſays <hi>David, of all them that fear thee, and do keep thy precepts.</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48564:66"/> for the Goſpel is the Miniſtration of the Spirit. <hi>The words that I ſpeak,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>are ſpirit and life</hi> Now two ſorts of Doctrines there are that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpel; The Doctrine of Natural Free-will, and the Doctrine of Legal and Jewiſh Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. The Doctrine of Natural Free-will is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſubſtance of the Goſpel, which is the Word of Grace. The Doctrine of Legal and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Ordinances is contrary to the diſpenſation of the Goſpel; and both carnal. The Doctrine of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Free-will is a carnal Doctrine; for ſaith <hi>John, chap.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Which are born not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man.</hi> The will of the fleſh, and the will of man go together.

And I appeal to your ſelves, ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> to the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> pleading for the power of Nature, and for Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Free-will, What is that which makes an outward difference between one man and another?<note place="margin">Nec tribuuntur iſta meritis volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum, ſicut ſunt celeritates, vires, bonae valetud nes, &amp; pulchritudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes corporum, ingenia mirabi ia, &amp; multarum artium capaces naturae mentium vel quae accidunt extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecus, ut eſt opulentia, nobilitas, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores, &amp; caetera hujuſmodi, quae quiſque ut habeat, non eſt niſi in Dei poteſtate, <hi>&amp;c.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48564:66"/> deformed, doth Mans Will make the difference, or Gods Providence? I ſuppoſe you will ſay, that it is Gods Providence, not Mans Will that doth make the difference. And if you ſay that Mans Will makes the difference in theſe outward things, and not Gods Providence, <hi>Are ye not carnal?</hi> How much more if you ſay, Mans Will, and not Gods Grace doth make the difference between one man and another in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things? As for the Doctrines of Legal and Jewiſh Ordinances, they are expreſly called <hi>carnal Commands,</hi> Heb. 9. Now poſſibly a Profeſſor of the Goſpel may be baptized into theſe Opinions, poſſibly he may hold the Doctrine of Free-will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel of Free Grace. Poſſibly he may be baptized into the Doctrines of Jewiſh Legal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Ceremonies, and Sabbaths, and of all the Opinions that are now ſtirring and ranging abroad. What Opinion is there, but the maintainers thereof do father it upon the Spirit? What Brat or Baſtard-opinion is there abroad, but men do come to lay it down at the door of the Goſpel, and father it upon the Spirit? Now when men do thus, may we not ſay to them, as the Apoſtle here, <hi>Are ye not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The more any Profeſſor is guilty of levity and lightneſs in the Wayes of the Goſpel, the more carnal he is; for ſays the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 1.17. <hi>When I therefore was thus minded, did I uſe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or things that I purpoſe, do I purpoſe according to the fleſh, that with me there ſhould be yea, yea, and nay, nay? But as God is true, our word towards you was not yea and nay.</hi> Levity therefore is a ſign of Carnality. Now there is a twofold Levity, one in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48564:67"/> regard of judgment, whereby men are unſettled in their judgment, ſaying yea to a Doctrine to day, and nay to morrow, or ſoon after. This levity of judgment is a ſign of carnality. The other levity is in regard of practice, whereby men are ſlight, vain, and frothy in their communication. Now poſſibly a Profeſſor may be thus light in both theſe reſpects. Some are light in regard of their judgement, unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; ſome are light in regard of their practice; for they can ſit and ſpend a whole Afternoon in vain conferences, and not a word of God of Chriſt. Are not theſe <hi>carnal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If there be little or no difference ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times between the carriage and behaviour of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour and of the men of the world; then poſſibly a Profeſſor may be very carnal. And what difference was there between <hi>David</hi> and the men of the world, in that matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah?</hi> What civil man would have done as <hi>David</hi> did? And ſo now though a Profeſſor may be very good and gracious, yet if he be ſtirred ſometime, in a buſineſs of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments; what difference is there between his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and the carriage of the world; may we not then ſay to ſuch, <hi>Are ye not carnal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If there be envyings, wranglings, ſtrifes, and diviſions amongſt the Profeſſors of the Goſpel; then 'tis poſſible that great Profeſſors may be very carnal; nay, that ye read in the Text, and I wiſh we might not read it in our daily experience; It is the property of a gracious ſpiritual frame of heart to rejoyce in others graces, and to mourn for others ſins; 'tis the property of a carnal heart to envy at others graces, and to rejoyce and triumph
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48564:67"/> over others failings. Now if Profeſſors be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, one of one judgment, and another of another, in caſe a man of another ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gment do fail or fall, what rejoycings will there be? if I were ſpiritual, then I ſhould more grieve for Gods diſhonour by the fall of a Profeſſor, then rejoyce at the fall of my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but yet ſo it is, though Gods name be diſhonored by his fall, becauſe he is a Profeſſor; yet another will triumph therein, becauſe he is his adverſary; is not this <hi>carnal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, If a Profeſſor of the Goſpel can neither give reproof without anger, nor take a reproof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtaſte, is he not <hi>carnal? you that are ſpiritual,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>reſtore him that is fallen, with the ſpirit of meekneſs.</hi> But now if an admonition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof be given, either it is given with anger, or it is taken with diſtaſte; Why? but becauſe we are <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6, If a Profeſſor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the Goſpel do uſe carnal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to obtain his deſigns, is he not carnal therein? now thus it may be poſſibly with ſome great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a good man, and a great Profeſſor, yet when he would ſecure and preſerve himſelf, he ſaid to <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſay, Thou art my Siſter. The thing was true, and no lye, but it was a carnal engine that he then uſed to obtain that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. We read of <hi>Abner,</hi> that when he would bring about the Kingdom to <hi>David,</hi> for his own prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then he went to the heads of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and told them of the promiſe that God made to <hi>David.</hi> Here
<q>Ne quis in honeſtas cupiditates religionis glaucomate obtegato <hi>Vide Cluveri Hiſtor. Mundi p. 108.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48564:68"/> he made uſe of a Religious Engine to obtain his own carnal ends. Sometimes men uſe their carnal Engines to obtain Religious deſigns; Sometimes they uſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions Engines to obtain their carnal ends, and what more ordinary then this, even amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. Why? But becauſe they are carnal.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the more ſelfiſh any man is in ſeeking his own parttcular intereſt in the time or cauſe of publick concernments, the more carnal he is, a ſelfiſh principle is a carnal principle; now this may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Profeſſors, <hi>Judges</hi> 5. Why ſays the Holy Ghoſt to <hi>Reuben,</hi> Why abideſt thou amongſt the Sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the Flock; and why did <hi>Dan</hi> remain in Ships; there was a great cauſe a foot, <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthali</hi> came forth, but as for <hi>Aſher</hi> they abode in the Creeks, <hi>Dan</hi> in the Ships, and <hi>Reuben</hi> abode among the Sheep-folds to hear the bleatings <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, ſays <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi>

Yet thus even thus it is with many Profeſſors at this day. Why; becauſe they are carnal; poſſibly then great Profeſſors may be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48564:68"/> very carnal, and that is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Firſt, For will you inſtance in our thoughts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, reaſonings, and concluſions? Is it not a carnal thing to abound with carnal reaſonings?

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Or will you inſtance in the matter of our affections? Is it not a carnal thing for a man to love and ſavour the things of the world? this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors may poſſibly do, witneſs the Parable of the Thorny ground,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Or will you inſtance in the matter of our words? Is it a carnal thing to bite and devour one another, and to carry Tales between men. Yet this the <hi>Galatians</hi> did, <hi>If ye bite one another, ſhall ye not be conſumed one of another.</hi> Gal, 5.15.</p>

                  </gap>ourthly, Or will you inſtance in the matter of our condition, Is it not a carnal thing to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with ones condition, and to think that I can carve better for my ſelf, then God hath carved?

               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:48564:69"/>
               <p>Fifthly, Or will ye inſtance in the matter of our lives, and reformation of our practice? Is it not a carnal thing, for a man to run from one extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <hi>Dum vitant ſtulti vitia, in contraria currant.</hi> Yet what more ordinary then this in the way of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from no liberty, to all liberty; from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digallity to covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. Or will ye inſtance in the matter of our duties? Is it not a carnal thing for a man that hears the word of God, to apply it to another, and not to apply it to himſelf? ſaying, That the Preacher met with ſuch an one, and not think of himſelf: or to be more taken with the volubility of expreſſion, then with the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of the ordinance: or if a man preach the word, Is it not a carnal thing to have flings and throughs at particular perſons, or to preach the Goſpel for Hire, that he may get a living thereby, or to preach Chriſt out of envy, yet this the Apoſtle ſays to the <hi>Philippians</hi> that ſome did in his days.</p>
               <p n="7">7ly. Or will ye inſtance in the matter of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſpecial communion with God? Is it not a carnal thing to deſire incomes from God, for the ſweetneſs of them. The ordinance of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is an ordinance wherein you enjoy much of God, and have ſpecial Communion with him: Yet you know how the Apoſtle blames the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their carnality therein, and if ye look into <hi>Luke</hi> 22.24. You ſhall find that even at the Lords Supper, the Diſciples of Chriſt were debating who ſhould be greateſt; a carnal thing for any of them to deſire greatneſs above the other: But that this queſtion ſhould be ſtarted then, what Carnality was here?</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48564:69"/>
               <p>Eighthly, Or will ye inſtance in our approach unto Chriſt, and coming to Chriſt? If carnality be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any thing, ſurely it will be excluded here; yet ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>henceforth know I no man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh,</hi> no not Chriſt himſelf; it ſeems that formerly they did thus know Chriſt himſelf, and were too carnal in their very knowledge of Chriſt, but ſaies Chriſt to thoſe that followed him, <hi>Ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me not becauſe of the miracles, but becauſe of the Loaves.</hi> Plainly then this carnality may extend and reach unto all our actions, and if there be no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that a Profeſſor can do, but this carnality, may get and ſoak into it; then ſurely this Doctrine is moſt true, that poſſibly a great Profeſſor may be very carnal, poſſibly great Profeſſors of the Goſpel may be very carnal, and ſo much for the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>3. <hi>General.</hi>
                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, if a Profeſſor may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and this carnality may poſſibly boyl up to ſuch an height; is there any difference then between the carnality of the World, and of the Profeſſors of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, much if Profeſſors be Godly, for all Profeſſors are not Godly. For though a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing good man may labour under much carnality, and be too fleſhly, yet he is not born after the fleſh; for ſaith the Ap ſtle <hi>Paul, Abraham had two ſons,</hi> Galat. 4.22. <hi>The one by a Bond-woman, the other by a free-woman,</hi> but he who was of the bond-woman, was born after the fleſh, but he of the free-woman, by the promiſe. Which things are an Allegory, for
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48564:70"/> theſe are the two Covenants; that is, the legal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Covenant of grace. Now we bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſaith he, <hi>verſe</hi> 28. as <hi>Iſaac was, are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Promiſe.</hi> We are born after the promiſe the promiſe comes and works grace in us; we are regenerated and born again by the word of the promiſe; and therefore though theſe children of <hi>Abraham</hi> may labour under much carnality; yet they are not born after the fleſh, as carnal, unregen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate men are, who are the children of the bond wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and belong to the legal Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, Though Profeſſing good men may be very carnal, yet there is a grace and goodneſs that doth run along therewithall, for they are the ſmoking flax, and though there may be much ſmoke and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality that may offend the eyes of beholders; yet there is a fire of grace and zeal that runs out therewithall. What a ſmoke did <hi>Jonah</hi> make when he ran away from God, and was froward and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh even with God himſelf? But though therein he was very carnal, yet ſtill there was a grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that did go along therewith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though a good man may be very carnal, yet he doth not ſowe to the fleſh, or ſavour and reliſh the things of the fleſh moſt. A carnal wicked man doth ſavour and reliſh the things of the fleſh; thus to be carnally minded is death, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>And thoſe that ſowe to the fleſh, ſhall reap corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, As for thoſe that are carnal and wicked it is not ſo with them, Though a good man may be very carnal, and may labour under much carnality, inſomuch as his parts may be too big for his grace,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48564:70"/> and his paſſions may be too big for his parts, yet he doth not take up a carnal prejudice againſt the whole way or power of Godlineſs, the wicked are carnal, and they are carnally prejudiced againſt the very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs in the ſtrictneſs of it. Poſſibly a good man may be prejudiced againſt this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way of God; but as for the power of Godlineſs, he is not carnally prejudiced againſt that.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Though a good man may be very carnal and labour under much carnality, yet that carnality doth not bear the rule and ſway in his life. <hi>Finis actionum Domina &amp; Regina.</hi> Look what a mans ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and utmoſt end is, that doth give a law unto all his actions, that rules,<note place="margin">Finis dat mediis amabilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ordinem &amp; menſuram.</note> that ſwayes, and is the yard wand unto all his actions; as for example, if the world and profit be my end, my general and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end, then my actions generally are directed and ſwayed by it: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd I muſt preach ſo much as may ſtand with my profit, I muſt go to meetings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſoul-opportunities ſo far as may ſtand with my profit, I muſt acquaint my ſelf with men ſo far as may ſtand with my profit; and if ſuch and ſuch things may not ſtand with my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rofit in the world, then I muſt not do the ſame. Why? becauſe the world is my great and utmoſt end, and every thing muſt ſtrike ſail unto it. Now I ſay, though a good man may labour under much carnality, yet there is no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thing that doth bear ſway with him as it doth in thoſe that are carnally wicked.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Though a good man may be very carnall yet his practical concluſions, and therefores are not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48564:71"/> ſo carnal, as the men of the Worlds are. Mark what carnal therefores the men and people of the world have, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.14, 15. <hi>I offered my peace offering, now therefore am I come forth to meet thee.</hi> A ſtrange there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as if ſhe ſhould ſay, I have been at duty, and at the ordinance; and therefore now am come forth to play the whore. Ye know alſo what a therefore <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> had, upon the Judgment of Chriſt, <hi>I find no fault with him, now therefore Scourge him and let him go.</hi>

                     <hi>Luke</hi> 23.16.</note> Oh ſtrange therefore, I find no fault with him, therefore whip him, nay, therefore whip him not, for I find no fault in him. Are there not ſuch therefores ſtill in the hearts of men, The Lord is gracious and merciful, Therefore I'le go on to ſin; The Lord is patient and forbearing, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I'le repent afterwards. But ſays <hi>David, O how great is thy loving kindneſs, therefore do the children of men put their truſt in thee.</hi> Though a good man be too carnal, yet he is not ſo carnal in his main infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and concluſions, as the carnal world is.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Though a good man may be very car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, yet he is very ſenſible of his carnality, and is much humbled; for when I ſaw, ſaid <hi>David,</hi> the proſperous eſtate of the wicked, then I had ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſonings as theſe, I have cleanſed my hands in vain; but ſays he, <hi>I was a beaſt therein, Pſal.</hi> 73.22. The more a man looks into the ſpirituality of the law, the more he will be ſenſible of his own carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Now a good man looks much upon that. As for the law, ſaies <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.14 <hi>That is holy, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, good, but I am carnal.</hi> Who was a more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Chriſtian then <hi>Paul?</hi> yet he was ſenſible of his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48564:71"/> carnality. Why? becauſe his eye was upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of the law; Now ſo it is with all thoſe that truly fear the Lord; they do not ſtand and compare themſelves with others: For that would augment their carnality, but they compare themſelves with the law and word of God; and ſo they are exceeding ſenſible of their own carnality, and are humbled for it. So that then now you ſee. There is a difference; And what that difference is; And though the carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the good Profeſſor be not ſo bad as the carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the world, and the men thereof, yet it is evil; the beſt of this carnality is naught, and if you ask me</p>

               <p>4. <hi>General,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the fourth place in many things it is a very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thing for a Profeſſor of the Goſpel to be carnal. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it not an evil thing for a man to walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto his Profeſſion: <hi>Peccatum majus ubi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnantia major;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Peccatum majus ubi ſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis repugnantia inter peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem et peccatum. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                  </note> is it not an evil thing for a Judge to do unjuſtly? Yea, Why? Becauſe it is contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his profeſſion Now the profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is ſpiritual, and the Profeſſors of the Goſpel are ſo deſcribed and called. The ſpiritual man judgeth all things; and ye that are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch an one, &amp;c. The Weapons of our War-fare, ſaith the Apoſtle, are not carnal. Carnal Weapons are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to carnal profeſſion, but ſpiritual weapons are ſuitable to ſpiritual profeſsion. 'Tis obſerved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48564:72"/> that the Weapons of the Papiſts in advancing their Religion, are very carnal; Somewhat they have in their religion which doth comply with every mans carnal humour. If a man be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edw. Sand</hi> Relig. Weſt.</note> they have a Cloyſter for him; If he be Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, they have their Schools for him; If a man or woman do pretend to chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they have their Nunneries and Priories for them; If a man be given to filthy wantonneſs, they have their allowed Stewes for him; If a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n be given to honour and greatneſs, they have a Cardinals Cap for him; And if he be given to deſpiſe and neglect the world, they have a Mendicant Fryers place for him. Some carnal thing ſtill they have that doth ſuit with the carnal and wicked humours of men. Why? but becauſe their warfare is carnal, and ſo the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of their warfare are carnal. But the Profeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſpiritual and reforming; how have they therefore advanced their Religion, but by powerful Preaching, Printing good books, Tranſlating the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into the vulgar tongue, Catechiſing and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the younger, open Diſputings for the truth, and Suffering for the ſame; Thus the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath been carried on by good and ſpiritual weapons. Why? for our war-fare is ſpiritual, now in theſe times we are upon another condition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, we are reforming the very Reformation and therefore the weapons of our war-fare ſhould be moſt ſpiritual; are we therefore carnal now in theſe days, then do we walk contrary unto our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Yea, though you be a good man yet
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48564:72"/> if you be carnal, you do thereby make your ſelf unfit both to do good, and receive good. Carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes you unfit to do good, it will hinder the vend of your commodities. I think ſometimes, ſays <hi>Luther,</hi> to convert all the Congregation, but the Auditor comes and ſmells ſomething of a man in what I ſay,<note place="margin">Sentit anima hominis verbum arte ſuper ſe compoſitum eſſe, &amp; ſtercore humano (ut apud <hi>Ezekielem</hi> eſt) opertum, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano affectu pollutum, ideo nauſeat ſuper illo, &amp; potius irritatur quam convertitur. <hi>Luther</hi> loc. com. claſ. <hi>4.</hi> de miniſter. verbi.</note> and ſo he turns away, and no good is done. And in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence what good doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition do, when admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in paſſion. This Carnality is an hinderance to your doing good; and as it is an hinderance to your doing, ſo it is an hinderance to your receiving it. It ſtops your Ears and Eyes; your Ears from hearing the Word, and your Eyes from ſeeing into the diſpenſations of God. Yea,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thereby you will be apt to give and to take offence. As this Carnality will make you unfit to do and receive good; ſo it will make you apt and ready to give and to take offence. Who more apt to give and take offence then young Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? And why ſo? but becauſe they are Babes, and carnal. Yea,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though you may have ſome real goodneſs in you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et if you be carnal, you may diſhonour God more by your carnality, then you may honour him by your goodneſs. And is it not an evil thing for a man to diſhonour God more by the carnality of his Profeſſion, then he can honour God by his Profeſſion?</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48564:73"/>
               <p>Fifthly, The more carnal you are, the more you are expoſed, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>poſe your ſelf to the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan, and his inſtruments. 'Twas a carnal thing for <hi>David</hi> to number the people; Satan ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this carnal affection, and the Text ſays, <hi>That he ſtirred him up to number the people.</hi> And if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have their carnal ends hanging out, what may not the Devil and his Agents add and joyn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? Yet,</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The more carnal you are in your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the more you will loſe the ſweetneſs of your Chriſtian Communion. What happineſs can a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpiritual heart take in converſing with a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſour? Suppoſe a man deal but in outward friendſhip, what happineſs can he have in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with one that is ſelfiſh, that ſeeks himſelf in all his acquaintance and converſe? Is there any happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that friendſhip where a man muſt always ſtand upon his guard, to keep himſelf from the ſelfiſh deſigns of him that he walks with? No ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Much more may I ſay in our ſpiritual Converſe and Communion. What happineſs, what ſweetneſs can I take in converſing with him that is ſelfiſh and carnal. Oh this Carnality is a great enemy to the ſweetneſs of Chriſtian Communion, it will eat out all the ſweetneſs of it. And</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It will hinder the advance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the ways of God, and knowledge of Chriſt: For what growth or advance can a people make in their practices, when Miniſters cannot advance them in their Preachings. Now ſays the Apoſtle here, <hi>I could not deliver to you ſtrong meat;</hi> why? <hi>Becauſe ye are carnal.</hi> Wherefore ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Would
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48564:73"/> you grow in grace? then laying aſide all malice and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of naughtineſs, as new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> How is it therefore with me? Am I a Profeſſor, and yet carnal? Then do I walk contrary unto my Profeſſion; Then am I thereby unfit to do good, or receive good; Then am I fit to take, and to give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; Then may I diſhonour God more by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of my profeſſion, then I may honor him by my profeſſion; Yea, and thereby do I expoſe my ſelf to the temptations of Satan, and the world. Then ſhall I loſe the ſweetneſs of Chriſtian Communion, and be kept from growth in Grace. Surely therefore it is an evil thing, and very evil for the Profeſſors of the Goſpel to be carnal; yet this may be poſſibly in great Profeſſours, Members of Churches, and men of great parts and gifts, and a good man too may be very carnal; ſuch were theſe <hi>Corinthians:</hi> Poſſibly therefore, a man may be a great Profeſſor, yet he may be very carnal. That s the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Now in the fifth place, If you ask what then is our duty that doth flow from hence? I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>General</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If great Profeſſors of the Goſpel may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carnal, then why ſhould any man ſtumble, or be offended at the ways of God and Godlineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the carnality of Profeſſours? Will ye be offended at that which which ye know muſt and ſhall come to paſs. <hi>Theſe things have I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that when they come to paſs, you may not be offended.</hi> Now he hath told us before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48564:74"/> 
                  <hi>That in the laſt days the Kingdom of Heaven is like to ten Virgins waiting for the coming of the Bridegroom, and they all ſleep;</hi> that is, There ſhall be a general ſcurf and carnality grow upon the face of all Profeſſion. And now ye know theſe things, will ye be offended? Or will ye be offended if your own offence will be your own r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine? <hi>Wo to the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe of offences; offences muſt come, and wo to him through whom they come.</hi> Here is a wo and a wo; A wo to the offender, and a wo to the offended. <hi>Wo to the world,</hi> why? becauſe their offence will be their own ruine. And whoever you are that are apt to be offended at theſe things; Either the lives of Profeſſours are the rule by which you walk, or the Scripture. If the lives of Profeſſours be the rule of your life; Then why do you not live as they do? as the beſt of them do? why are you not rather convinced by their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then ſtumbled by their carnality? And if Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be your rule, why then do you not ſay in the midſt of all theſe carnalities, Well! yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the Scripture, and Godlineſs is Godlineſs; and therefore though all men have their failings, and the faireſt face hath its wart, and there is none ſo ſpiritual, but hath ſome carnality; <hi>Yet I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord;</hi> for I walk by Scripture; and Scripture is Scripture ſtill, and Godlineſs is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſtill. O take heed and be not offended. That's the firſt Uſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If great Profeſſors of the Goſpel may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Then why ſhould we not all take heed of their carnality? Poſſibly a Member of a Church may be carnal, and ſhall not we then take heed of carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48564:74"/> Poſſibly a man of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rts, and Gifts, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces too may be carnal, and very carnal, and ſhall not we then take heed of carnality? And in caſe that we have been, or are carnal in our Profeſſion, why ſhould we not all labour to ſcale off this Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what ſhall we do herein? I confeſs I have been and am very carnal in my Profeſſion, what ſhall I therefore do that I may be rid of this carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and be more ſpiritual?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In caſe you have been carnal, be humbled for it; A man will never leave a ſin for the time to come, unleſs he be humbled for the time paſt. Now who is there in all the Congregation, but may cry guilty, guilty? I am the man or woman that have been carnal under my Spiritual and Goſpel-profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Why then, go to God and humble your ſelf before him, in reference to the carnality of your Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In caſe you have begun a Profeſſion of Chriſt, be ſure that you look well to your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and ſettings out. 'Tis poſſible that a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beginning may make a ſpiritual ending; but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily if men ſet out the wrong way at the firſt, they go wrong all the day after. And it is uſual with men to be carnal at the entrance into their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Facite me,</hi> &amp;c. ſaid he, Make me Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I will be a Chriſtian: But <hi>dimidium fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti,</hi> He that hath well begun hath done half his work. Be ſure therefore that you look to your beginnings, and firſt ſettings out for Godlineſs. And in caſe,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That you are a Profeſſor of ſome ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Then make it your work and buſineſs to go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48564:75"/> your work again, and to refine your work. <hi>Ye are now come to that mount, where the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you wine upon the lees well refined.</hi> Ordinances refined, and Goſpel enjoyments refined. And what do theſe call for but a refined Converſation? And how ſhould that be, but by making it your work and buſineſs to refine all your duties. True, I have prayed many times, but now I will go and refine all my prayers. I have converſed with the Saints, now I will go and refine my converſes; yea, I will make it my work now to refine my works.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether you be of long or late ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Religion pray much for the pourings forth of the Spirit upon you. Ye read in the Goſpel, that the Diſciples were very carnal before Chriſts Death; but after his Aſcenſion, then they were very ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: Why? becauſe the Holy Ghoſt was then fallen down upon them. Would ye be more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and leſs carnal, pray for the pourings out of the Holy Ghoſt upon your Souls. And</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed of a ſelfiſh ſpirit, eſpecially in matters of Religion; for a ſelfiſh ſpirit is a carnal ſpirit. The more plainneſs of heart you have, the more free you will be from deſigns and ſelfiſh car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalities. Go therefore to the Lord, and pray unto him for a plain and open ſpirit. And</p>
               <p>Sixthly, And in caſe you are to deal with any fleſhly concernment, there watch moſt. A good man ſhould be ſpiritual in carnal things. But when we meddle with carnal things, we are apt to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized with them; and therefore the more carnal the concernment is, the more do you watch and pray, leſt you enter into this temptation.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48564:75"/>
               <p>Seventhly, Be ſure that you take heed of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with carnal and wicked company: <hi>Evil words corrupt good manners,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And what good words ſhall ye have with them? With them ye ſhall meet with that which will prejudice you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what is good, and thoſe that are good. Would ye therefore be freed from the Carnality of Profeſſion? Take heed how you come into carnal wicked company. And in the 8th. place.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Call your ſelf often to an account, and examine your ways, Whether they be ſpiritual or carnal. Come, O my Soul, thou haſt been in ſuch a company! but haſt thou not been frothy, vain, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, or carnal in it? Thou haſt been this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that are ſpiritual; but haſt not thou been carnal in the midſt of them? Come, O my Soul, thou haſt been at ſuch a work this day, but haſt thou not been ſelfiſh in it? Haſt not thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſeen therein? Haſt not thou been carnal even in thy ſpirituals? Thus daily call your ſelves to an account. And</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Conſider but this one thing, That the only way to loſe a mercy, is to be carnal in it. If you be a Profeſſor, one that God loves, the more carnal Engines you uſe to obtain a mercy, the more like you are to loſe it; and in avoiding of miſery, the more carnal your Engines are to avoid it, the more like it is for to come upon you: If you be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ungodly, the Lord it may be will let you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your ends by your carnal Engines: But if you be godly, the more carnal Engines you uſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a mercy, the more like you are to loſe it. Now therefore as you do deſire to avoid miſery, and to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48564:76"/> obtain mercy, Labour to be more ſpiritual; Take heed of carnal Engines in all your deſigns; Make it your work and buſineſs to be more ſpiritual; Reſt not upon your holy mount, ſaying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord;</hi> for it is carnal; And take heed of diviſions, ſtrifes, and envyings; <hi>For if theſe things be among us, are we not carnal?</hi> And this ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> eaſily be; for you ſee the Text, and you remember the Doctrine. Poſſibly great Profeſſors may be very carnal. Wherefore let us all make it our work and buſineſs to be more ſpiritual.</p>

               <p>Secondly, As the words do imply Authority, ſo they do imply an Ability. For though a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n have the power of Authority to do a work, yet if he have not the power of Ability to do it, it is not in the power of his hand to do it. <hi>Knoweſt thou not,</hi> ſaid <hi>Laban</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 31.29. <hi>that it is in the power of my hand to do thee hurt;</hi> that is, Knoweſt thou not that I have power, and ſtrength, and ability for to do thee hurt. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the words do imply an Ability, ſo they do imply Opportunity and Occaſion; for though a man have both power of Authority and of Ability to do a work, yet if he have not Opportunity to do it, that work is not in the power of his hand to do. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10 7. <hi>And let it be when theſe ſigns are come unto thee, that thou do as occaſion ſhall ſerve.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as your Margent tells you, it is, <hi>as thy hand ſhall find to do.</hi> And if ye look into Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, you ſhall find that a man is ſaid to do that work which he doth occaſion, though that work be done by another. See <hi>Acts</hi> 1.18. It's ſaid of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, That he purchaſed a field with the reward of iniquity.</hi> In Mat. 27.3, 5. <hi>He brought the thirty pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſilver to the Prieſts, and threw them down in the Temple, and departed.</hi> If he threw them down in the Temple, and left them with the Prieſts, how did he purchaſe the field? Yes, ſays the interlineary Gloſs, <hi>Poſſidit quia poſſideri fecit,</hi> He purchaſed it, becauſe he did that work which did adminiſter the occaſion of this purchaſe. Look therefore when a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48564:78"/> work is within the compaſs of our commiſſion, and which we have ability and opportunity to do, then it is truly ſaid to be in the power of our hand, and that is the work which our hand finds to do; So that whatever work, that is, which God doth betruſt us with, if we have ability and opportunity to do it, that we are to do with all our might.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Well, but then ſecondly, When may a man be ſaid to do this work of God with his might, or with all his might.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it imports five things, Firſt, He that will do the work of God with all his might, muſt do it with all his ſoul in oppoſition unto heart-diviſion. As in the New Teſtament, there is mention of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>a double-minded man:</hi> So in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ye read of a divided heart, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>An heart and an heart.</hi> And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Heart</hi> is ſometimes put for the affections, and ſometimes for the conſcience: Yea, the Hebrew hath no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per word for conſcience, but the word heart. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays the Apoſtle. <hi>If thy heart condemn thee,</hi> that is, <hi>if thy conſcience condemn thee,</hi> that's an <hi>Hebraiſme.</hi> Now the heart of the affection may run one way, and the heart of the conſcience may go another way. The heart of <hi>Herods</hi> conſcience went with <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> but the heart of his affection went with the Dancing damſel. The heart of a Drunkards conſcience is to leave his Drunkenneſs, but the heart of his affections is to his drunken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But where a man doth the work of the Lord with all his might, he doth it with all his ſoul, in oppoſition unto Heart-diviſion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48564:78"/>2. And ſecondly, As he muſt do it with all his ſoul in oppoſition unto heart-diviſion, ſo he muſt do the work of the Lord with all his underſtanding, in oppoſition unto unskilfulneſs. For ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For as the Philoſopher obſerves, All remiſneſs doth ariſe from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome contrary: Now where there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the contrary, a man cannot do his work with all his might. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As he muſt do Gods work with all his affection, in oppoſition unto Luke-warmneſs; ſo he muſt do it with all his ability, in oppoſition to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> did not do Gods work with all their might; Why? becauſe they had their Reſerves: But <hi>Moſes</hi> did Gods work with all his might, when he brought the people out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> Why? becauſe he left not an hoof behind him, he had no Reſerves. So now, when a man will not leave an hoof behind him, but doth Gods work
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48564:79"/> without all reſerves; then he doth it with all his might. Yet</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As he muſt do it with all his ability, in oppoſition unto all Reſerves; ſo he muſt do it with his diligence and induſtry, in oppoſition unto ſloth and negligence. <hi>For he that is ſlothful in his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is brother to the ſcatterer,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> Do you therefore ask when a man may be ſaid to do Gods work with all his might?

               <p>Well, but then thirdly, Why and upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or reaſon muſt we do Gods work with all our might?</p>
               <p>I anſwer. 1. It is Gods will we ſhould do ſo; it is his Commandment, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might.</hi> Here are three Alls; <hi>All thy ſoul, all thy heart, and all thy might.</hi> And leſt you ſhould think that there may be ſome abatement in New Teſtament-times, ye ſhall find, that when Chriſt cites thoſe words in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.27. he addes a fourth All. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind.</hi> Here are four Alls. There is no abatement then in our Goſpel times. Now if this be the mind and will of God, is not this reaſon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48564:79"/> enough for us? I have read of one Biſhop in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, whoſe name was <hi>Quodvulteus,</hi> that is, <hi>Quod vult Deus, What God will.</hi> And indeed methinks that this ſhould be the name of every Chriſtian, <hi>Quodvulteus, What-God-will.</hi> We all profeſs our ſelves the Children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> He went blindfold into Gods Commandments, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to a Blanck. Now we have Commandment for this both in the Old and New Teſtament. It is Scriptural.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As is is Scriptural, ſo it is a rational thing that we ſhould do Gods work with all our might. For is it not a reaſonable thing that we ſhould give God his due, his own?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now all our might is Gods due. <hi>Non eſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votionis,</hi> ſays <hi>Proſper.</hi> It is not matter of devotion to give all unto God within a little, <hi>ſed fraudis eſt,</hi> it's matter of fraud to keep a little from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And is it not a reaſonable thing for us to love God, <hi>who hath loved us, and given himſelf for us and to us?</hi> Who is the proper Object of our love, <hi>and altogether lovely.</hi> Who only gives the affection of love, and the thing loved; and who only can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe your love with love again. Now it is the only meaſure of true Love to know no meaſure. <hi>Non amat, qui non zelat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And is it not a reaſonable thing that we ſhould do Gods work as fully as our own? Now if you have any buſineſs to do in the world, you will turn every ſtone, you will do it with all your might. Have you not ſinn'd with all your might? and ſhall your ſins be crying ſins, and your prayers whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers? Will you run when the world calls, and

               <p>Fourthly, Is it not a reaſonable thing that we ſhould do that work with all our might which is our only work, and the work which we came into the world for? Now we did not come in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve nothing here to do but to ſerve the Lord; all other things are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to that. And if you look into Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, you ſhall find that the Lord only ſtands upon this work. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ord, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve, onely let your converſation be as becometh,</hi> &amp;c. Here doth the <hi>onely</hi> ſtand. Yea, ſays <hi>Solomon,</hi> this is the whole of man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole of man.</hi> The word <hi>duty</hi> is not in the Original: But <hi>fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole of man.</hi> Now is it not rational that we ſhould give God his due? That we ſhould love God; That we ſhould do his work as fully as our own; That we ſhould do that work with all our might, which is our onely work. Surely therefore it's very rational that we ſhould do Gods work with all our might. Yet</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As it is rational that we ſhould do thus, ſo it is a dangerous thing not to do it. <hi>For curſed is every one that doth the work of the Lord negligently.</hi> Sloth and the Curſe grow together upon one ſtalk. The <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> do obſerve, that there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Amen</hi> that is not right, which, ſay they, is followed with a threefold anſwerable puniſhment. There is <hi>Amen amputatum, Amen acceleratum,</hi> and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48564:80"/> 
                  <hi>Amen Pupillare,</hi> or <hi>Orban Amen: Amputatum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> when a man doth cut ſhort his duty, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> unto half duty: <hi>Amen acceleratum,</hi> Is when he doth huddle over his duty and ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to an haſtened duty: <hi>Amen Pupillare,</hi> As when a man doth perform his duty without underſtanding &amp; heart, and doth ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to he knows not what. Now ſay they, If a man ſhall cut ſhort his duty, God ſhall cut ſhort his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; If a man ſhall haſten and huddle over his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, God will haſten and not prolong his days; And if a man ſhall perform his duty without heart and underſtanding, then his Children ſhall be Orphans; as his duty was without heart and knowledge, ſo his Children ſhall be without Parents. Thus they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the puniſhment of doing Gods work negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ye know what the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that hath in his Flock a Male, and offers a corrupt thing to God;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that man or woman who hath Maſculine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the world, and Female affections for the work of God. O now if it be the will and mind of God that we ſhould do his work with all our might; &amp; a rational thing to do ſo; And a dangerous thing not to do it; Then ſurely it is our duty and matter of great concernment to do the work that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to do, <hi>with all our might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why? But will ſome ſay this ſeems contrary to Scripture, Reaſon, and our own Judgment; to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe the world as if you uſed it not;</hi> To Reaſon, for the Magiſtrate is to do Juſtice, and if he do it with all his might, there will be <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> and <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> is <hi>ſumma inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> and to our own Judgment, for according to

               <p>Yes, very well, for doth the Scripture ſay that <hi>we are to uſe the world as if we uſed it not?</hi> and doth it ſay here, <hi>whatever is in the power of thine hand to do, do it withall thy might;</hi> Then put theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what is the reſult but this, That we ſhould uſe all our skill and might, <hi>to uſe the world as if we uſed it not.</hi> And as for the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſon about the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, though the Magiſtrate is to do juſtice, yet he is to ſhew mercy alſo; if he have righteouſneſs in the one hand he is to have mercy in the other; <hi>I will ſing of mercy and judgment</hi> ſaith <hi>David; Seneca</hi> tells us, that many puniſhments are as much diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Magiſtrate, as many Funerals are to the Phyſician. Ye know that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, and did not he doe juſtice? yes, yet he was the meekeſt man upon earth; Why ſo? but to ſhew that the diſpenſations of juſtice will grow very well upon the diſpoſition of meekneſs. And as for our own principles and Judgment who doth not ſay, and ſay true, That every man hath power to do more then he doth; and what if I ſhould ſay with ſome, That God will condemn no man for that ſin, which he hath not a power to avoid. The Heathens ye know are judged by the law of nature, but though they are not able to keep the whole law of nature, yet they are able to avoid theſe ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, for which they are condemned; ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48564:81"/> the Goſpel, though a man be not able to convert and turn unto God, and to keep the whole law of the Goſpel; yet he may be able to avoid the ſins againſt the Goſpel, as poſitive unbelief and reſiſtance, for which he ſhall be condemned, thus ſome; But I need not ſay thus, neither ſhall I need to enter into this debate here, for whoever liveth under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is either Godly or ungodly; if he be ungodly, he hath power to do more then he doth; and if he be Godly his will is freed; for <hi>whom the ſon makes free, he is free indeed,</hi> though his will be not <hi>libera, free,</hi> yet his will is <hi>liberata</hi> freed; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, So that thus now you ſee there is nothing in this truth that is contrary to Scripture, Reaſon, or our own Principles; yet give me leave to bound it with two Cautions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though you muſt do Gods work withall your might, yet <hi>your moderation muſt be known unto all men;</hi> Some will not let Gods work paſs through their hands, but they will have ſome tole for their own intereſt. <hi>Joſhua</hi> did not ſo, he conquered the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and when he came to divide it, what a little Thong did he cut out of that Leather for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family; Some will not do Gods work, but they will carry it on with their own paſſion. It's ſaid of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> that great Souldier, that when he ſpake ſometimes of Chriſt, he would be ſo earneſt that the bloud would ſpirt out of his lips: But as Gods grace has no need of our ſin, ſo his work hath no need of our paſſions; Though therefore you do the work of the Lord with all your might, yet you are to manage it with mildneſs and ſweetneſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo your moderation is to be known to all.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48564:82"/>2. Though you do the work of your hand with all your might, yet you muſt not look upon the ſucceſs of your work as the fruit of your hand, but of Gods hand; when <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out againſt <hi>Amaleck, Moſes</hi> lift up his hands, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed; then <hi>Joſhua</hi> built an Altar, and called it <hi>Jehova-niſſi;</hi> for ſays the Text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.15. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn that he will have war with Amaleck;</hi> but <hi>ver.</hi> 16. in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as the Margent tells, It is the hand on the Throne of the Lord, and why ſays <hi>Glaſſius,</hi> is it ſaid the hand on the throne of the Lord, but to ſhew that this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory was not from <hi>Moſes</hi> hand, though it was a praying hand, but from Gods hand. <hi>Luther</hi> tells us of <hi>Staupitius,</hi> that when he came to his Government he ſaid, I will govern according to Law; But when he ſaw that his Government did not ſucceed, then he ſaid I will govern according to the cuſtoms of the place; When he ſaw that ſucceeded not, then ſaid he, I will govern by the Scripture; When he ſaw that ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not well, then ſaid he, I will do what I can accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture and Law, and leave the ſucceſs unto God; and then his Government proſpered. And you ſee how it is with a Child, a Father bids him do this or that which he knows the child cannot do; therefore he ſecretly puts his own hand to the work, and he praiſes his child, and the child thinks that his hand did it. So here God bids us do his work, with all our might, &amp; we do ſo &amp; have ſucceſs in the work, and we think the ſucceſs is the fruit of our hand, whereas in truth it is the fruit of our fathers hand. Mark therefore what follows in the next words to the Text, in this verſe ſaith <hi>Solomon, Whatever thou findeſt in thy hand to do,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48564:82"/> do it with all thy might;</hi> but in the next words ſays, <hi>I returned and ſaw, that the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battel to the ſtrong.</hi> Why doth he add theſe words immediately, but to ſhew thus much, that though we do Gods work withall our might, yet we muſt not look upon the ſucceſs as the fruit of our own hand; And thus now this Doctrine is cleared, proved, vindicated, and cautioned; and ſo I come to the Application.</p>

It is the work of the Magiſtrate to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe juſtice and righteouſneſs, ſo as to encourage the good, and be a terror to evil doers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. It is the work of the Magiſtrate to aſſiſt the Miniſter.

Or ſuppoſe you be a Miniſter, it is the work of the Miniſter to walk before the people, as the <hi>Dux gregis</hi> before the reſt of the Flock, in all holy life and godly converſation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is continual preaching, it is the work of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48564:83"/> Miniſter to ſtudy the Scriptures much, for he hath more help that way then others,; it is the work of the Miniſter to preach the word plainly, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, and continually both for conviction, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and edification; it is the work of the Miniſter to ſeparate between the precious and the vile, in Church Adminiſtrations; it is the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to bind up the broken hearted, to comfort the afflicted, to viſit and pray over the ſick, <hi>Is any one ſick, let hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or ſuppoſe you be the Governour of a Family, Father, or Maſter; or you be Governed, a child or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, It is the work of the Governour to bring up his children, or ſervants in the Nurture and Education of the Lord. It is the work of Inferiours to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their Parents or Maſter; It is the work of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and thoſe that are young, to learn ſome Trade &amp; Calling, that they may live like men and women ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and do good to others; it is the work of thoſe that are young to ſtock and ſtore themſelves with principles of Religion. <hi>Luther,</hi> a great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the Church, profeſſed that he was yet <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmi Diſcipulus.</hi> And what is the reaſon ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> that men fall into errors when they are men? but becauſe they did not learn the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion when they were young. Or ſuppoſe you be one of this Town, or of theſe Congregations, It is your work to pray for them that are over you in the Lord. It is your work to attend on the means of Grace, to receive the Goſpel, and to improve your Goſpel opportunities. Have you forgotten O ye people of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> how far ye would run and go formerly for a diſhful of water; and now a Spring
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48564:84"/> and fountain of Grace is opened amongſt you; will ye not improve it? if a Mine of Gold or Silver be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in a Country, will they not dig it out. Now through grace there is a Mine of Goſpel Treaſures opened amongſt you, and will ye not dig for it as for hidden Treaſure? This is your work, for look what that work is which is the work of your calling, place, and relation, that is the work that is in the power of your hand to do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Look what that work is, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to that ſin wherein you have notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly lived, or been guilty of, that is the work which God calls you to, and is in the power of your hand. I have read of a young man that was much given to ſcorning, jeering, and deſpiſing of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but after it pleaſed God to work ſavingly upon his heart, when ever he ſaw his Mother come into the room, he would fall down upon his knees. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not his diſcretion. But if ye look into the New Teſtament, ye ſhall meet with three great Converts. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the Jaylor, and <hi>Paul,</hi> and what did they do, but that work which was directly contrary to the ſin which they were notoriouſly guilty of and given to? <hi>Zacheus</hi> had been an oppreſſor, but being converted, <hi>Behold Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have wronged any man I reſtore four-fold;</hi> The Jaylor whipped the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>poſtles, and put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stocks in the inner Priſon, but when converted then he brought them into his houſe, waſhed their ſtripes, and ſet meat before them. <hi>Paul</hi> was notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for blaſpheming, and perſecuted the Church, but when converted then he preached the Goſpel, which before he perſecuted, So that look what that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48564:84"/> work is which is directly contrary to your notorious ſin; that is the work that God calls you to, and which your hand ſhould find to do.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Look what that work is which you are ſpared or raiſed up for, either from poverty or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is the work which is in the power of your hand now to do. There is a great Controverſie at this day, How Gods Predetermination, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mans Will can conſiſt or ſtand together; The reconcilement whereof was committed to <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Arriva,</hi> which he ſhunning, fell into a great ſickneſs? ſo dangerous; that the Phyſicians gave him over for a dead man? but all of a ſudden, in a days time he revived, and was ſo well, that the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could not believe that he was well; but be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, thought that he was ſpared on purpoſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that work of Reconcilement, Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he did, and hath ſaid as much in it as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And you know what <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eſther, Who knows but God raiſed thee up on purpoſe,</hi> &amp;c. Look therefore what that work is which your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poverty or ſickneſs points at, and for which you are thus raiſed up, that is the work that is in the power of your hand to do. Yea,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Look what that work is that you have ſpecial ability and opportunity to do above others, that is the work that is in the power of your hand to do. As ſuppoſe you have a great Eſtate in the world, and have no Children; It is your work to relieve and help the poor. Therefore, ſays <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Prov. 3.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt not withhold goods from the owners thereof, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</hi> Would ye therefore know what that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48564:85"/> work is which is in the power of your hand? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in theſe five things. Look what that work is which is the work of your preſent day, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done in Heaven nor Hell: What work that is that is the work of your place or relation: What work that is that is directly oppoſite to your notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſin: What that work is which you are ſpared and raiſed up for: And what work that is which you have an ability and opportunity to do above others. That and all theſe are the works which are in the power of your hand to do.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, If you would do Gods work with all your might, Then you muſt obſerve where your true ſtrength lyes, and apply your ſelf thereunto, Now your ſtrength lyes in Chriſt the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs and our ſtrength.</hi> Under Chriſt your ſtrength lyes in your call to your work. <hi>Go in this thy might,</hi> ſaid the Lord to <hi>Gideon,</hi> when he gave him a call. Under Chriſt your ſtrength lyes in the promiſe, for <hi>Lex jubet, Gratia juvat: The Law commands, and the Promiſe helps.</hi> Under Chriſt your ſtrength lyes in your comfort: He works faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that doth work uncomfortably. <hi>The joy of the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> It's true in this ſenſe; and under Chriſt your ſtrength lyes in dependance upon God for ſtrength. <hi>Our ſtrength is to ſit ſtill;</hi> That is to depend and wait on God for his ſtrength. Herein lyes your true ſtrength. Would you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do Gods work with all your might, then away to your true ſtrength.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, If you would do Gods work with all your might; then take heed that you do not think the way to Heaven is eaſie; nor that any thing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48564:85"/> is ſmall that lyes between God and you. <hi>Difficultas acuit conatum. Difficulty ſharpens diligence.</hi> But if a man thinks a thing is eaſie, he will not put his full ſtrength and might to the work. <hi>Greg. de Valentia</hi> tells of a Merchant, that profeſſed he would be a Papiſt, and no Proteſtant; For ſaid he, If I be a Papiſt, my work is ſhort and eaſie; 'tis but, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the Church believes: But if I be a Lutheran, then I muſt learn Catechiſms, and ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but I have no time for that; therefore I will be a Papiſt, for that way is eaſie. But we know, that the way to Heaven is up hill. <hi>Nulla virtus ſine la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide. Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life.</hi> And the more ye ſee theſe difficulties of your Salvation, the more you will put your whole ſtrength to it, and will work with all your might.</p>
               <p>Yet fourthly, If you would do Gods work with all your might, Then let your eye be much upon them that have done Gods work fully in their day. If you be a Magiſtrate, think on <hi>Moſes;</hi> If a Miniſter, think on <hi>Paul;</hi> If a private perſon, think on <hi>Caleb.</hi> It's recorded of <hi>Luther,</hi> That he did ordinarily ſpend three hours every day in Prayer; he Preached much, Read Lectures, and Wrote nine or ten great Volumes <hi>in Folio.</hi> It's recorded of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> That he Preached yearly Two hundred and eighty Sermons, and Read One hundred and eighty Lectures; every Lecture being the length of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Once in a Week he met with the Elders of the Church. Much in private Duty, and wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to all the Churches. So that the Care of all the Churches lay upon him; and he wrote twelve great
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48564:86"/> Volumes <hi>in Folio.</hi> Ye have ſeen the three Volumes of Mr. <hi>Perkins in Folio,</hi> all which he wrote with his Left-hand, for his Right-hand was naturally lame: His Motto was, <hi>Hoc age;</hi> As if he had ſaid, What thou doſt, do with thy might. Dr. <hi>Sibbs</hi> his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem, was a Candle burning with theſe words over it, <hi>Perlucendo pereo; By giving light to others, I conſume my ſelf.</hi> And ye have heard of that good old man Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> who went <hi>up and down doing good,</hi> and Preaching all the day long: When his friends obſerved that he was ſpent, and deſired him to ſpare himſelf, his uſual Saying was, <hi>Hear this one thing more, it may be I ſhall never ſpeak to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</hi> And ſo he went on, and continued till he was Eighty ſix; and ſo died in his full ſtrength of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now when I conſider theſe Men, I confeſs before you all, that I am aſhamed. And if men would but ſeriouſly conſider theſe and ſuch like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of men that have done much for God in their day; They would certainly be provoked to do Gods work with all their might.</p>
               <p>Yet fifthly, If you would do Gods work with all your might, Then converſe much with the greatneſs of God. Who can ſtand in the Beams of the Sun, and not ſhine with the beams thereof? Much leſs ſhall you ſtand in the beams of Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and not ſhine therewith. The ſight of Gods greatneſs will <hi>grandire,</hi> greaten your hearts and ſpirits, and make them do much and great things for God. Therefore converſe much with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. But</p>
               <p>In the ſixth place, Be ſure that you lay in againſt reproches. For when you ride apace, the Dogs
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48564:86"/> will bark, and the duſt will be raiſed: If you go ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, you raiſe no duſt, neither will the dogs bark. So if you will go a ſlow pace to Heaven, you ſhall not be reviled, or reproched by the world; But if you will put on with all your might, then you ſhall be reproched. Therefore if you will do Gods work with all your might, you muſt be well laid in againſt all reproches, becauſe it is the work of your hand.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh place, If you would do it with all your might, Then you muſt go to God to open your hand; And when he ſhall open your hand, and breath upon your ſoul, be ſure that you improve all thoſe gales. For <hi>Job</hi> tells us, <hi>That he ſealeth up the hand of every man, that all men may know his work.</hi> Sometimes he ſeals up the hand of the Sea-men, that they cannot ſayl; Sometimes he ſealeth up the hand of the Husbandmen, that they cannot ſowe nor reap; Sometimes he ſealeth up the hand of the Merchant and Tradeſman, that he cannot vend his commodity; Sometimes the hand of the Preacher, that he cannot preach; Sometimes the hand of the Chriſtian, that he cannot pray. And why doth he thus ſeal up the hand of every man, but that all may know his work? Would ye therefore do the work of your hand with all you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> might, then go to God to open and unſeal your hand; and if he breath upon your heart, then be ſure that you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove theſe gales. This is the ſeventh Direction.</p>
               <p>Do ye therefore now ask, What ſhall I do, that I may do the work of God with all my might. Then remember theſe Seven Things.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:48564:87"/>
               <p>Firſt, You muſt know what that work is which is in the power of your hand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You muſt obſerve where your true ſtrength lyes, and apply your ſelf thereto.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You muſt not think the way to Heaven eaſie, or any thing ſmall that is between God and you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You muſt eye them much, who have ſerved God fully in their day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, You muſt converſe much with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, You muſt be well laid-in againſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches.</p>
               <p>And then ſeventhly, You muſt go to God to open and unſeal your hand, improving all his gales. Now give me leave to lay ſome three or four Motives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, that may perſwade hereunto, and I ſhall wind up all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The firſt Motive is this, Look whatever work that is which is in the power of your hand to do, that God will require at your hand. If you be a Magiſtrate, and it be your work to preſerve peace, to ſuppreſs the multitude of Ale-houſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Lords-day, Then God will require this at your hand. If you be a Miniſter, and it be your work to <hi>Preach the Goſpel in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon;</hi> Then God will require this work at your hand. If you be a Parent, and it be your work to bring up your Children in the nurture and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord. If you be a Child or young perſon, and it be your work to ſtock your ſelf with Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion; Then God will require theſe works at your hands. And if you be one of this Town,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48564:87"/> and of this Congregation, and it be your work to receive the Goſpel, and to improve your day of grace, Then God will require this work at your hand. Remember the Parable of the Talents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If God will require the work of our hands at our hands; Why ſhall we not do that work with all our might? But</p>
               <p>Secondly, As God will call you to an account for all that work which is in the power of your hand; So you do not know how ſoon he may take your work out of your hands; how ſoon he may take you from your work, or your work from you. We ordinarily think that we ſhall not dye before our work be done: But if you look wiſhly upon Gods Diſpenſations, you ſhall find that Death doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſs men from their Shop-board, when much work is cut out before them. You all know what an uſeful man good King <hi>Joſiah</hi> was, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, yet he dyed in the midſt of his work, when he was but Thirty nine years old! Ye know what an uſeful man <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was; yet he died in the midſt of his days, when not above Thirty three years old. Is it not known to ſome what a great Workman Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> was here in <hi>England,</hi> of whom it was ſaid, <hi>That he never was leſs idle, then when idle;</hi> yet he died in the midſt of his work, when he was but Fourty four years old. It is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily known what a bleſſed Inſtrument Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> was, of whom the Preacher ſaid at his Funeral, <hi>Here lyes that bleſſed</hi> Perkins, <hi>who firſt taught</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>for to worſhip God;</hi> yet he died in the midſt of his work, when he was but Fourty ſeven years old. And who hath not heard of Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> what
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48564:88"/> a great Workman he was in Gods Vineyard; of whom I may ſay, Who though dead, yet ſpeaketh in his precious Books that are amongſt you; yet he died in the midſt of his Work, when he was but Fourty one years old. I might inſtance in Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> and others; yea, in divers good Chriſtians in this place, who have died in the midſt of their work and time. It was not long ſince a Preacher now in Heaven preached on this Text at the <hi>Guild</hi> at <hi>Norwich,</hi> at the Inſtallment of the Mayor; and before the year came about, the Mayor died. So that Death doth ſometimes preſs us from our Shop-board before our work be made up. And I pray mind the Text a little, <hi>Whatever is in the power of thine hand to do, do it with all thy might:</hi> For ſays <hi>Solomon, In the grave there is no work nor device whither thou goeſt.</hi> He doth not ſay, Whither thou ſhalt go, or whither thou muſt go, but <hi>whither thou goeſt.</hi> You go ſometimes to Church, and ſometimes not; you go ſometimes to Sea, and ſometimes not; you go ſometimes into the Countrey, and ſometimes not: But whether you go to the Church, or whether you go to Sea, or whether you go into the Countrey, ſtill thou goeſt to the Grave. And ye know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The night cometh wherein no man work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Now if the night cometh, and thou goeſt; then why ſhould you not do your work with all your might whilſt it is day. Certainly he that plays away his day, ſhall go to bed in the dark. But in the third place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Who is therein all this Congregation, that doth not deſire a comfortable Death-bed when it comes. As the Heathen man ſaid to a great
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48564:88"/> congregation, I know all your thoughts, for every man deſires to buy cheap, and to ſell dear; So in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I may ſay, I know all your thoughts, <hi>viz.</hi> that when death comes you may have a comfortable death bed: In the time of your death-bed-ſickneſs; you will then be able to do little; when your pains ſhall be great, you will be able to pray little, to hear little, to read or meditate litle, and then what will be your comfort in that death-bed-little but this? Well, though I can do but little now, yet I have pray'd and ſerv'd God with all my might, when I was well, and therefore I have comfort now. Now therefore if you deſire that you may have much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in your death-bed-little, why ſhould you not do the preſent work of your hand with all your might? But,</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the laſt place, Who is there in all this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that doth not deſire to rejoyce with all his heart in theſe bleſſings which he hath in his hand; now look once more upon the words of the Text, and ye ſhall find, that as <hi>Solomon</hi> in Gods name <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to rejoyce with all your heart in the bleſſings which you have, verſe</hi> 7, 8, 9. So in theſe words he commands you <hi>to do Gods work with all your might;</hi> And why are theſe things thus knit together? but to teach us thus much, That whoever will do with all his might the work that is in his hand to do, he may and ſhall rejoyce with all his heart in the bleſſings which he hath in his hand to enjoy. But above all ye know how fully Chriſt did your work for you, and will you do his work by halfes; never ſpeak of reſt here, there is reſt enough in the grave, and recompence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in heaven: Either the work that is in your
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48564:89"/> hand is worth your while, or it is not; if it be not worth your while, why ſhould you do it at all? and if it be worth your while, why ſhould you not do it with all your might? And O that there were an heart in you all to do ſo! If the weight of this truth have fallen in power upon your ſouls, I dare ſay, Some of you will go away and ſay, what have I done all this while? I confeſs <hi>I</hi> have done Gods work by the by, and when <hi>I</hi> heard Miniſters preſſing ſuch truths as theſe, <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, well, yet I hope I may go to Heaven with leſs ado, but now through grace I will go away, and what ever is in the power of my hand to do, I will do it with all my might. Thus do, and I ſhall obtain the end of my preaching, and you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt ſhall obtain the end of your practice the Salvation of your ſouls. Wherefore think on all theſe things and the Lord bleſs them to you.</p>

Now if ye ask why Chriſt did at this time eſpecially commend and reſign himſelf and ſoul up to God, I anſwer for many reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thereby he teſtified that he had not loſt his confidence in God as a Father, in the former words he had cryed out and ſaid, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me:</hi> Men might think: if he had ſo dyed) that he had quite loſt his confidence; but now that he concludes all with this, it ſhews, that God had not forſaken him, and that he had not loſt his confidence in God. Poſſibly a dying Chriſtian may be in an Agony at the beginning of his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet may ſweetly believe at the laſt. n
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48564:90"/> the former part of his death, Chriſt was in an Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but he cloſes up all with full aſſurance of faith. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into thy hands I commend my ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Thereby alſo he did commend the ſouls of all thoſe that he dyed for, into the hands of God; for he was now offering up himſelf through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpirit unto God for us, as our common perſon, and as in his Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17. he did not only pray for himſelf, but for us; So in this act and deed he did commend the ſouls and ſpirits of all thoſe that he dyed for into the hands of God: As he dyed in our room and ſtead, ſo in our room he ſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when ſhould he do this more fitly, then at the laſt of his ſuffering?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thereby alſo he became an example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; that when we come to dye or ſuffer, we ſhould dye with the Scripture in our hearts and mouthes, for this was Scripture, as ye read <hi>Pſal</hi> 31.5. And that we ſhould ſuffer and dye believing and reſigning up our ſelves and ſouls into the hands of God as a Father. And for this end certainly Chriſt did now ſpeak theſe words, for ſays he, <hi>I have power to lay down my life, and to take it up again;</hi> and if he had power to take it up again, why did he reſign it into the hands of God, as a <hi>Depoſitum</hi> to be kept for him? Surely for this reaſon, that in all this matter he might be an example unto us of Soul-reſignation into the hands of God. And ſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Doctrine.</label>
               </p>
               <p>It is a good thing for us to reſign up our ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48564:91"/> the hands of God, and that eſpecially at the time of our death and greateſt ſufferings, what Chriſt did, and did as our example, that is good for us to do: this hath Chriſt done before us; good therefore it is for us to do it, good at all times; eſpecially at ſome times; and moſt eſpecially at the time of our death and ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Firſt; It is Gods due, And it is our duty; for what is reſignation of our ſouls or ſelves unto God, but that act of faith, whereby we do put our ſelves under the power, wiſdom, and mercy of God, to be ordered and diſpoſed of according to the good will of God; this is our duty, and it is Gods due. Is it not the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an inferiour to reſign up himſelf and his will to the hands and will of his ſuperiour? Doth not the Wife reſign up her will to the will of her Husband? The Servant to the will of his Maſter? The child to the will of his Father? And is not God much more our Superiour? Is not be our Husband, our Lord, our Father, in moſt tranſcendent manner? Surely then, this Soul-reſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nation is both Gods due, &amp; it is our duty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Yea, and it is a very profitable thing for us to do it, hereby we make a virtue of neceſſity? &amp; where can we lodge our ſouls in ſafer hands? If a man cannot keep a thing himſelf, but muſt betruſt and depoſite it in other hands: Will he not doe it in the ſafeſt hands that he can find? Now three things there are that are required to a ſafe hand: Power, Wiſdom, and Love; If I depoſite a thing in a mans hand to keep, he muſt be able to keep it for me againſt violence, elſe his hand is no ſafe hand. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly though he be able and have power to keep it for me, yet if he be prodigal and laviſh, and not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48564:91"/> wiſe, I ſhall not count his hand a ſafe hand to keep my <hi>Depoſitum.</hi> But thirdly, tho gh he be never ſo wiſe, yet if he be not my friend, I ſhall not betruſt him with any great matter: But if a man be able, wiſe, and friendly, Then his hand is a ſafe hand to keep my <hi>Depoſitum.</hi> Now Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, And if we do n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

If we commit our ſouls int Gods hands, he will be reſponſible for them. <hi>Who will keep that which I have committed to him unto that day,</hi> ſays <hi>Paul;</hi> but if we d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not c mmit our ſouls into his hands to keep, and they get any hurt, we muſt be reſponſible for them our ſelves. And are we able to anſwer for our own ſouls? Surely no. Oh what a good thing is it then to reſign and commit our ſouls unto God.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:48564:92"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What benefit ſhall we get thereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Much every way. This reſignation of our ſouls and ſelves unto God, is an in-let to man, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Graces, and Comforts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As for mercies and bleſſings, What greater bleſsing can there be in this world, then to enj y ones ſelf? under God to enjoy ones ſelf, and to be free from all things? <hi>Paul</hi> counted it a bleſsing to have the comforts of this world, and to be under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of none, but to ſtand free from all; Now there is no ſuch way in the world to ſtand free from all things, as to reſign up our ſelves, ſouls and wills unto God. <hi>Haec eſt vera libertas ſervire Deo, True liberty doth conſiſt in perfect ſubjection to God;</hi> Who more free then Chriſt, yet who more ſubject to the will of God then Chriſt? <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done:</hi> no ſuch way to enjoy ones ſelf, as to give up our ſelves unto God. Doth not the Begger enjoy her ſelf moſt in giving up her ſelf to a Prince for marriage?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Yea, what greater bleſsing is there in the world, or in the world to come, then to enjoy God? Now if you do reſign and give up your ſelf unto God, you ſhall enjoy God, for God will give down himſelf unto you. 'Tis obſerved, That God the Father never gave down that great diſpenſation of the Spirit unto Chriſt, till Chriſt had thus reſigned up his ſpirit unto the father. Look what we do give up to God, that God will give down to us in a better edition; yea, he will not only give our ſelves to our ſelves, if we reſign our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but if you reſign and give up your ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he will give down himſelf unto you, if you
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48564:92"/> reſign up your ſpirit unto him, he will give down his Spirit unto you. Thus this Soul-reſignation is an In-let to this mercy.</p>
               <p>Yet thirdly, You will all ſay, It is a great mercy and bleſſing to have your prayers and deſires grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Then read <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e would, as to reſign up our wills unto God. Thus this Soul or Self-Reſignation is an In-let unto many mercies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As it is an In-let unto many bleſſings; So it is an In-let unto many graces and duties. What grace or duty will ye inſtance in? Will ye inſtance in Prayer?</p>
               <p>Firſt, It opens the Sluices of Prayer; and (as one ſpeaks well) though you pray ne're ſo long or loud, yet if you do not reſign up your Soul and Will unto God, your prayer is but non-ſenſe, and a contradiction <hi>in re.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Or will ye inſtance in Faith? Faith is a truſting unto God. Now the more you betruſt God with your ſelf, the more you truſt to God. And what greater betruſtment, then the Reſignation of ones Soul unto God?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thereby you ſhall be contented with your condition whatever it be, with the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: For there is a twofold contentment. One, that ariſes from the fullneſs of your enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Another, that ariſes from the apprehenſion of the wiſe carving hand of God. This laſt is beſt, and the moſt refined. Now if you can but truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign your ſelf and Will unto God, you will be thus contented.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:48564:93"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Thereby alſo you will rejoyce in God, and mourn for ſin at once; Some mourn for ſin, and neglect joy in God; Some joy in God, and neglect grief for ſin. But if I can truly reſign my ſelf unto God, I ſhall grieve for ſin, and rejoyce in God together.</p>
               <p>Yea fifthly, Thereby alſo you will be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto your Temptations, eſpecially that great Temptation that lies ſo hard upon ſome. You are now in a good condition; but ſuppoſe it were ſo and ſo with you! What would you do then? Why, if ye have reſigned your ſelf unto God, you'l be able to ſay, I do not know what may befall me; but I am ſure nothing ſhall come amiſs; for I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned my ſelf and my Will unto God. Thus this holy Reſignation is (ye ſee) an In-let to many g a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and duties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As it is an In-let unto many graces; So it is an In-let alſo unto many comforts; yea indeed, unto all our comforts: For what comfort can a man have in himſelf or condition, till he hath truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and given up himſelf, and Soul, and Will unto God; but being done, ye may freely go about your buſineſs. If a man have a Suit in Law, and have left his Cauſe in the hand of an able careful friend and Lawyer, he is quiet: Much more may we be quiet, when we have left and lodged our Caſe, and Way, and Soul with God. <hi>Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Prov. 16.3. Not thy buſineſs and works, but thy thoughts ſhall be then at reſt. Do not all things reſt in their Center? And is not God our Center? The more indifferently that a mans heart is carried out
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48564:94"/> towards changes, the more quiet and ſedate is his ſpirit. Now when a man hath reſigned himſelf up to God, then he will be more indifferent unto all conditions. The private Souldier doth march in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, this way or that way, at the command of his Leader; Why? Becauſe he hath reſigned up himſelf to the wiſdom of his Commander. The Sheep is indifferently led into this Paſture, or the other; Why? Becauſe reſigned up to the will of the Shepherd. So if our Souls be truly reſigned up to God, we ſha l be indifferently carried to this or that Paſture: for we are the ſheep of Chriſt. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a notable ſpeech that <hi>Luther</hi> had to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon; Melancthon</hi> being much troubled about the affairs of the Churches, and the low eſtate of the ſame, <hi>Luther</hi> wrote a Letter to him; and in that Letter he hath this expreſſion; <hi>Thou art much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and afflicted, O</hi> Melancthon; <hi>et</hi> Philip <hi>is to be admoniſhed and deſired to leave governing the world:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sed monendus eſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus,</hi> ut d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The only way therefore to be quiet within, is to reſign and give up all unto God This Self or Soul-reſignation is an In-let unto many mercies, an In let unto many graces, an In-let unto many comforts; Surely therefore it is a good and an excellent thing to reſign and give up our ſelves unto God.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:48564:94"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt</hi> VVell, but then how is this work to be done, that we may truly reſign and give up our ſelves, our ſouls, and our wills unto God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not to be done ſleightly and overly, but ſeriouſly and ſolemnly. It is an ordinary thing with men to ſay, <hi>The will of the Lord be done. Gods will be done,</hi> and the like. But it is one thing for a man to be indifferent in a buſineſs, ſaying, <hi>The will of the Lord be done;</hi> and another thing for a man to give up himſelf and will effectually unto God. It is one thing for a man to do this in a ſleighty and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way, ſaying, <hi>The will of the Lord be done;</hi> and another thing, to make a diſtinct and clear Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will to the will of God in particular things. Look into Scripture, and ye ſhall find, that wherever this work was done truly, it was done ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, and ſeriouſly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As this work is not to be done ſleightly and overly; So neither is it to be done forcedly and laſtly, but freely and firſtly. The firſt thing I do, I muſt commit my ſelf, and cauſe, and will unto God. If a City or Town be beſieged, it yields and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns at the laſt, becauſe it can hold out no longer: But this Reſignation is a forced work; the Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves and wills unto God is not ſuch. VVhen <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could ſtand out no longer, then he reſigned up the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> And ſo when men can hold out no longer, then they ſay, <hi>Well, it is the will of God that this thing ſhould be; wherefore now the will of the Lord be done.</hi> VVhen they can do no other, Then they reſign up the thing and themſelves unto God. But this true Reſignation is done freely and firſtly, not forcedly, and at laſt.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48564:95"/>
               <p>Thirdly, As it is not to be done laſtly and forced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, So it is not to be done partially, and by halfs, but fully and totally. <hi>I am thine,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> to God, <hi>Oh ſave me.</hi> Pſ. 119.94. When a man comes to God for mercy, he pleads not for part, but all. He doth not ſay, O ſave my body, and not my ſoul; but <hi>Oh ſave me:</hi> Nor doth he ſay, Oh ſave my ſoul, and not my body; But <hi>I am thine, Oh ſave me.</hi> When a man deſires pardon of ſin, he deſires not the pardon of ſome, but of all. When God gives himſelf unto us, he gives himſelf wholly. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves unto God, is a great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a great Offering, and it muſt be of all, an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locauſt. God cannot, will not take leſs then all. He that reſigns himſelf unto God, with a reſervation of a part, doth like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira;</hi> He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the whole, and gives but part, and ſo he doth lye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As this Reſignation muſt not be done partially, and by halfs; So it muſt not be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, but abſolutely. When you have taken a Servant, and you bid him do this or that, it may be he'l ſay to you, It was none of my bargain, I bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained with you for to be yo r Steward, but not to be your Groom in your Stable: Or I bargained with you to be your Clerk, but not to be your Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian; this or that work which you ſet me about, is not according to my conditions. And ſo when a City beſieged doth reſign, it doth reſign upon Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; But when a Soul doth truly reſign it ſelf unto God, Then no Articles, no Conditions. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> ſays <hi>Paul,</hi> Oh any thing, Lord, any thing: I will return to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48564:95"/> houſe, <hi>and let him make me his hired ſervant.</hi> Do but receive me Lord, and I'le not article with thee; it's a Reſignation without Articles. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, whereby God doth give himſelf to us, is abſolute, and not conditional; So is that Covenant, whereby we do reſign and give up our ſelves unto him. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſubſcribed to a blanck; ſo muſt all the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> do.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As this Reſignation is not to be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally; So it is not to be done paſſively, and in a way of ſubmiſſion onely, but actively. It's one thing for a man to ſubmit unto Gods will, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing to reſign up himſelf and will to the will of God. A man is properly ſaid to ſubmit, when he quietly yields unto what is done. A man is ſaid to reſign up himſelf and will unto God, when he doth quietly yield over his affections to the thing done as beſt, becauſe God wills it. For example, I meet a Thief on the way, and he takes my Purſe; I ſubmit becauſe I cannot help my ſelf; but I do not reſign up my will to his will: I reſign up my money into his hand, but not my will unto his will, nor my affections and judgment to the thing done; judging that good which is done. But when a man doth truly reſign up himſelf unto God, he reſigns up his thoughts and judgment to the wiſdom of God; It is not a bare ſubmiſſion unto what is done.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, As this Reſignation is not to be done paſſively; So it is not to be done deceitfully and feignedly, but in all p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er.</hi> 42. The people of the <hi>Jews</hi> come to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for them, and they ſay, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>The Lord be a true and faithful witneſs between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God ſhall ſend thee to us; whether it be good, or whether it be evil,</hi> &amp;c Wherefore <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Lord for them, but they would not do what they ſaid; Whereupon ſaid <hi>Jeremiah, ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Ye diſſembled in your hearts, when ye ſaid, We will do according to all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay.</hi> So that there is a lying ſubmiſſion, whereby men in affliction and diſtreſs, do feignedly ſubmit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign themſelves up to God. Poſſibly a man may hear, that the onely way to have his will, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up his will unto God. Now that he may have his will, he will reſign it up unto God: This is but to ſerve himſelf of God. But where this work is truly done, it is done with the greateſt plainneſs of heart, and the moſt ſincerity.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, As this work is not to be done feignedly; So it is not to be done ſinfully, but in well-doing. Some ſay, <hi>The will of the Lord be done;</hi> and they ſay they do reſign and give up themſelves unto God: But if ye look into 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. he will tell you, That this work is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in well-doing. <hi>Let him commit his ſoul to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48564:96"/> God in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creatour.</hi> And thus ye ſee how this work is to be done rightly.</p>
               <p>It is to be done Solemnly, and not ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Freely and firſtly, not forcedly and laſtly; Wholly and totally, and not partially and by halves; Abſolutely, and not conditionally, upon Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; Actively, and not in a way of ſubmiſſion one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; With much plainneſs and ſincerity; And in well-doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Well, but when is this work to be done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is to be done daily. Once done, and yet ever doing. But there are ſome times wherein this work is to be done eſpecially, but moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at our death.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, this work is to be done daily. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a man is to reſign up his will unto God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Health; Sometimes in reference to his outward Eſtate; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ometimes in reference to his Relations; Sometimes in reference to his ſpiritual Condition. But as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Truſt in the Lord at all times;</hi> So I ſay, we are to reſign up ſelves, and Souls, and Will to God at all times.</p>
               <p>Yet ſecondly, There are ſome ſpecial times and ſeaſons which do call for this work. I'le name Five.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When a man doth convert and turn unto God, Then he is in a ſpecial manner to reſign and give up himſelf unto God. <hi>What wilt thou have me do?</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> at his firſt Converſion. The Prieſts that offered Sacrifices unto God, were firſt offered themſelves. After Converſion we do daily offer
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48564:97"/> our Sacrifices to God: At the firſt therefore, we are to offer up our ſelves unto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When a man is called forth unto any great work, or ſervice, or employment, eſpecially if it be beyond his own ſtrength and power, Then he is to reſign and give up himſelf unto God: So <hi>Moſes</hi> did; So <hi>David</hi> did; So all the Worthies of God have ever done, when they have been called out to any great employments.</p>
               <p>Third<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, When a man is in any great danger, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and affliction, Then he is to reſign and give up himſelf and will unto God. <hi>If the Lord have any pleaſure in me</hi> (ſays <hi>David) he will bring me back again; yet if not, his will be done.</hi> So <hi>Joab,</hi> when he ſaw that enemies were round about him; <hi>Let us fight,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for the cities of our God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the will of the Lord be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen a man doth joyn himſelf unto the Lord and his people, Then he is eſpecially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and give up himſelf unto God. So the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Macedonia</hi> did; for ſays <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.5. <hi>And this they did, not as we hoped, but firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, When a man hath ſinned greatly, and wandred from the Lord, and from his holy Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and doth return again unto God, Then he is in a ſpecial manner to reſign and give up himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: The ſame thing is to be done in our renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in our firſt Converſion. And if ye look into 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. ye ſhall find, that when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> had gone aſtray, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> exhorting them to return unto the Lord, he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Now be ye not ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked as your fathers were, but yield your ſelves
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48564:97"/> unto the Lord:</hi> Margent, Give you your hand unto God. When we have ſtollen any thing from God, it is our duty to reſtore it. Have we therefore in our firſt Converſion given our ſelves unto God, and afterward by our ſins taken them away ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in? whenever we do return unto God, then it is our duty to reſtore, and ſo to reſign up our ſelves unto him. And thus now ye ſee what thoſe ſpecial times and ſeaſons are which call for this work at our hands. The times of Converſion c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lls for it; The time of ſpecial Employment calls for it; The time of great danger calls for it; The time of joyning to the Lord and his people calls for it; And the times of our returns unto God after wandrings calls for it.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, Though we are to reſign our ſelves unto God in ſuch times as theſe are ſpecially; Yet moſt eſpecially we are to do it when we come to ſuffer; for then God is ready to receive us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.4. Then men are ready to deſtroy us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.14. <hi>The poor committeth himſelf to thee:</hi> When we come to dye: For then did Chriſt do it eſpecially. Then the Soul is to return unto him that gave it. It doth not dye or ſleep with the body in the grave, but it returns unto him that gave it <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And the Apoſtle tells us, That Paradiſe is the third heavens, and the place of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I deſire to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi> How can a man be ſaid to be with Chriſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his death, if the ſoul dyes, and ſleeps with the body? <hi>Yea,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am in a ſtrait;</hi> in reſpect to you I deſire to live: in reſpect of my ſelf I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48564:98"/> deſire to dye. But if the ſoul ſleeps and dyes with the body, why ſhould not he deſire to live in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of himſelf? When the man dyes, then the ſoul and ſpirit returneth to him that gave it. When a man therefore dyes, it is fit to reſign and give up his ſoul unto God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When a man dyes then, if his ſoul goes to Heaven, it is to paſs through the Enemies Countrey; for Satan is <hi>the Prince of the air.</hi> The Air is full of Devils; the ſoul therefore hath need of a good Convoy to paſs through this Enemies Countrey. And how ſhould a man get this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, but by reſigning and giving up his ſoul into the hands of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When a man dyes, Then he launches forth into the Ocean of Eternity; And as God is the diſpoſer of our times for the preſent, ſo of our Eternity alſo. Fit it is that we ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Sovereignty over us, in reference to our Eternity: And therefore when a man comes to dye, he is in a ſpecial manner to reſign and give up himſelf unto God, to be laid out and diſpoſed of to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And when a man comes to dye, Then there is a great parting between the ſoul and the body; Then I part with that which is moſt dear to me. Now when a man parts with his Children, or thoſe things that are dear to him, he will put them into the ſafeſt hands that he can; But when we come to dye, then is the great parting-time: And therefore then and then eſpecially we are to reſign and give up our ſelves and our ſouls unto God. Thus Chriſt did; <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:48564:98"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> VVell, But how and by what means ſhall I be able to reſign and give up my ſelf and ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God when I dye, ſo as I may receive this <hi>Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> again to my comfort?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is good for us to enquire into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; VVe know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not how ſoon we may be called to this dying work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the Candle be newly lighted, it may eaſily be put out; and if it have burned long, it will eaſily go out. 'Twas the deſire of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius,</hi> That Chriſts laſt word on the Croſs,<note place="margin">Domine, fac ut ultimum tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um verbum in cruce, ſit etiam ubimum meum verbum in hac luce. <hi>Gera d. ex Dionyſ. harm. cap. 17.</hi>
                  </note> might be the laſt word of his life. Do you therefore deſire to cloſe up your life with this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reſignation according to Chriſts Example. Then,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Be ſure that you do not give away your ſoul from God to any thing elſe whilſt you live. If you have given away your ſoul unto other things whilſt you live, it will be a vain thing for you to ſay Chriſts words when you come to dye. VVhen men come to their death, ye know they do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily make their VVills; And in the firſt place they ſay, I give my ſoul unto God; Then if they have Lands, or Houſes, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oney, they give them to their VVives, Children, Relations, and Friends, according to their pleaſure. But ſuppoſe now, That a man ſhall give Land or Houſe to ſuch or ſuch a Child or Friend, which he hath ſold or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away before; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hall his VVill ſtand in force? VVill not all men ſay, This he could not give away, for he had ſold that, or given that before. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48564:99"/> regard of ones ſoul; Though upon my death I ſay, As for my ſoul, I give that to God, yet if I have ſold away my ſoul before for unjuſt gain, or have given away my ſoul before unto filthy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; How can I reſign and give that to God when I dye? VVill not the Lord ſay, Nay, this is none of yours to give; this you had ſold or given away before. Oh then be ſure of this, That whileſt you live, you do not ſell or give away your ſoul from God; for then Death-bed-reſignation will be but as the Act and Deed of a man that makes his VVill when he is not <hi>compos mentis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would ſo reſign your ſoul unto God when you dye, that you may receive this <hi>Depoſitum</hi> again with comfort; Then be ſure that you make God your Friend whileſt you live: Elſe what repoſe can you put on him when you dye. VVho doth truſt a Jewel in the hands of a ſtranger or enemy? VVe read <hi>Judges</hi> 10.14. when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had forſaken the Lord, and ſerved other gods, that when they cried to the Lord to ſave them out of the hands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the Lord ſaid unto them, <hi>Go and cry unto the gods which ye have choſen, and let them ſave you in the time of your tribulation.</hi> So will the Lord ſay to us, if in the time of our health we follow after our pleaſures, and profits, and our old ſins, <hi>Go and cry to the gods whom ye have ſerved;</hi> go and repoſe your ſouls in their hands, and let them help you now if they can. No man will repoſe or commit that which he prizeth into the hands of a ſtranger or enemy. O then, whilſt we have our health and life, let us make God our Friend.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:48564:99"/>
               <p>Thirdly, And not only ſo; but get an aſſurance that God is your Friend and Father: Though God be our friend, if we do not know it, how ſhall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſouls to him when we dye. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I know whom I have truſted, that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him unto that day.</hi> It's an hard thing for a doubting heart that cannot ſay Father diſtinctly, to reſign as Chriſt did. VVhy then ſhould you live upon hopes mingled with uncertainties; is it not yet time to get your aſſurance? Oh labour more and more to attain to theſe riſes of aſſurance; for the more aſſurance you have when you come to dye, the more eaſily and truly you will ſay, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, And if you would reſign up your ſoul unto the hands of God, ſo as you may receive that <hi>Depoſitum</hi> again with comfort; Then obſerve what that <hi>Depoſitum</hi> is which God doth now truſt you with, and be you faithful in the keeping thereof. VVhen Chriſt went away, he left us a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> he did leave and depoſite ſome of his things in our hands; his Truths, his Ordinances, his Talents, and if I do not keep his truſt, his Truths, his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, his Talents, how can I expect that he ſhould keep my ſoul for me? Mark how theſe go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have truſted,</hi> ſays <hi>Paul, and I am perſwaded he is able to keep that which I have committed to him.</hi> Then ver. 14. <hi>that good thing which was committed unto thee, keep.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, As we deſire that he ſhould keep our truſt; ſo we muſt keep his truſt. Some things the Lord hath committed to us; Some things
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48564:100"/> we commit to him. Now therefore, as you do deſire that he may keep your ſouls for you; So do you keep his Truths, his Ordinances, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath committed unto you.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And if you would be able to do this work of Soul-reſignation in the day of your death rightly; then uſe your ſelf to do it every day. That is eaſily done, which is often done. And if you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the example of Chriſt, ye ſhall find, That as ſoon as he drew near to the Croſs, the firſt thing he did, was, to reſign up his Will unto God, being in his agony in the Garden. <hi>If it be poſſible,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let this cup paſs; yet not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> And the laſt thing he did, was to reſign up his ſoul unto God. This affliction was begun and ended with holy reſignation. It's begun with a reſignation of his Will, it's ended with a reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Soul. So ſhould all our afflictions be begun and ended with Self-reſignation; And if I can but begin my affliction with the reſignation of my Will unto the Will of God, I ſhall end the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the reſignation of my Soul into the hands of God; And the more frequently I do it whilſt I live, the more eaſily I ſhall do it when I dye; and ſay in truth with Chriſt, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Study the Sovereignty of God; The more your heart is poſſeſſed with Gods Sovereignty, the more Reſignation. <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eli, let him do what ſeemeth good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. <hi>And good is the word of the Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings 20.19.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Then behold this Example of Chriſt, being before you, <hi>whom beholding,</hi> &amp;c. The ſight
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48564:100"/> of a reſigning Chriſt will make you reſign and ſay, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus now I have done with this laſt ſpeech of Chriſt on the Croſs. The words of dying Friends are precious, and we remember them. Now ye have heard this living ſaying of a dying Chriſt. You that are the friends of Chriſt will remember them; and the Lord teach us ſo to remember them, that thereby we may learn both to live and to dye, both to do and to ſuffer.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, What we ſhould do, that we may walk worthy of God who hath called us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This Vocation is an Act of Gods Grace and Mercy; whereby we are invited to the great Supper of the Goſpel, to Communion and Fellowſhip with Chriſt. As it is an act of Gods grace and mercy, ſo it is oppoſed to works. Rom. 9.11. <hi>For the children being yet unborn, neither having done good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand; not of works, but of him that calleth.</hi> Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is oppoſite to works. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our works, but according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and grace,</hi> &amp;c. Vocation is an act of Gods grace wholly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men are invited to the great Supper of the Goſpel, that is, to Fellowſhip and Communion with Chriſt. 1 Cor. 1.9. <hi>God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:48564:102"/>
               <p>If you look unto the perſons that are invited to the great Supper. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.1, 2, 3. [that great Supper is nothing but Communion and Fellowſhip with Chriſt] thoſe that are invited. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.3. are ſaid to be called. <hi>He ſent forth his ſervants to call them that were bidden to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> And of thoſe that refuſed to come, it is ſaid, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> v. 14.</p>
               <p>Onely this Invitation to Communion and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt, is to be conſidered two ways. Firſt, Meerly and barely, as it is an act of God inviting by the Word. Or ſecondly, As it implies our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer or conſent to that Invitation. As when a man is called to an Office either in Church or State, he is ſaid to be called, though he does not accept of it; but when election and voluntary acceptation meet together, then there is a call. So our heavenly Call, taking it in a large ſenſe: All that live under the Goſpel are called, and invited. But in a proper and ſtrict ſenſe men are ſaid to be called onely, when they accept, and conſent upon Gods Invitation. This diſtinction is very neceſſary: For <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14 it is ſaid, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> And Rom 8.30. it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>That whom he hath, predeſtinated, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified.</hi> If thoſe that are called, are predeſtinated and juſtified, how is it true, <hi>That many are called, and few are choſen?</hi> I anſwer, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Calling in a large ſenſe, for a bare Invitation, many are called. Taking Calling in a ſtrict ſenſe; as implying our anſwer, and acceptation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto; ſo none are called but thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Call, and are brought home to God. Gods
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48564:103"/> Calling is an effectual Invitation of a perſon to the great Supper of the Goſpel, whereby a man does accept it, and is brought home to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How does it appear, That when God brings home a man to himſelf, he does it in a way of calling; and why ſo? I anſwer, If our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be called our calling; and the Saints are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by their calling: The thing is true; <hi>Make your calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. that is your Converſion. Rom. 1.6 7. <hi>Among whom alſo are ye the called of God, Called to be Saints.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. Saints by Calling. If the Saints and people of God be deſcribed by the <hi>Called-ones,</hi> and our Converſion be termed our <hi>Calling;</hi> Then when God brings home a man to himſelf, he does it in a way of Calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe thoſe that God brings home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are afar off. We call men that are afar off: If they be near, we ſpeak to them. By nature we are afar off from God; therefore when he converts men, he is ſaid to call. Acts 2.14.39. <hi>Peter ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and ſaid to them, Ye men of Judea,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hearken to my words,</hi> v. 14. <hi>For the promiſe is to you, and to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to all that are afar off, even to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> v. 39. Called upon this account, becauſe <hi>ye are afar off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Is it not neceſſary that we ſhould be conformed to Chriſt our Head, and to <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father, <hi>the father of the faithful?</hi> You ſhall find <hi>Abraham</hi> was called Iſa. 51.2. <hi>Look unto Abraham your father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for I called him alone.</hi> Chriſt is alſo ſaid to be called in a way ſuitable to him.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48564:103"/> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my ſon.</hi> Heb. 5.4. <hi>No man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that was called of God, as was</hi> Aaron. Iſa. 4.26. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 49.1. <hi>Liſten, O iſles unto me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Lord hath called me from the womb.</hi> We are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Chriſt our Head, and to <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father in our calling.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If God ſhall bring a man home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, according to the practice of men, he muſt bring him home in a way of calling. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man,</hi> Hoſ. 11.4. When God deals with man, it is in a way ſuitable to man: But why? When he brings a man home to himſelf, will he do it in a way of calling, when as he might do it immediately by his own infinite power? If I knew that a man would not accept my Invitation to Dinner, I would never ſend to invite him. God knows that every one will not come, what need he then ſtand calling and inviting? We muſt conſider, That as God will deal with man in the way, and according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men; So he will deal with man alſo in the way of God too. Chriſt is God-man. <hi>God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.6. Becauſe the work of our Redemption was to be carried on by the hand of God, and by the hand of man both. Whereas ſhould God deal with man only as God, then he would convert him preſently by his own infinite po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, and never make any invitation to him: And if he ſhould deal with man onely as man, he would never invite any of the dead: For who is there of you that will ſend to the grave, and invite a dead man to your table? But as God, he invites dead
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48564:104"/> ones. There are ſome that think Chriſt need not to invite, becauſe he can bring men home to himſelf by his own almighty power: But ſuch do forget that the Deity works as a man. Others think men are to be converted onely by moral ſwaſions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions: Such do forget that Chriſt works as God too. But Chriſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God man becauſe the great work of our Redemption and Salvation, is to be carried on by the hand of both. As God, he does invite and call irreſiſtably, omnipotently: As man, he invites by perſwaſion: As God-man, he invites, and gives a heart to accept of his invitation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If all thoſe bleſſings and mercies we are call'd to, are called Gods bleſſings and mercies (as ſo they are, <hi>Who ha's called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2 9. <hi>Who hath called us to his Kingdom and Glory</hi>) it were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in me to meddle with the things of God, with <hi>the things that are Gods,</hi> if he did not invite me to it: But if a Begger comes to your houſe, and ſhall ſit down at your table; he does not preſume, becauſe you have invited him. God will have his people know, that they do not preſume when they come at his Invitation, and call and meddle with the things of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If all the work of Chriſtianity be beſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with difficulty, and affliction; we had need be called thereunto; for in the time of affliction or difficulty, what ſhall bear up our heart, and carry us through, but Gods Call: Gods Call is our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and our ſtrength, therefore fit that all that are brought home to God, it ſhould be in a way of Calling.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:48564:104"/>
               <p>Thirdly, What is the duty (then) of all that are called to Gods Kingdom and Glory?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; It is their duty to walk worthy of God. By worthy is not meant a worthineſs of Merit. No; There is a four-fold Worthineſs mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard of Merit; So onely Chriſt is worthy. <hi>For thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals,</hi> Rev. 5.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of Acceptation; So the Saints are worthy. <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy,</hi> Rev. 3.4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In regard of Proportion; So <hi>Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent afflictions are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. That is, there is no proportion between the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the afflictions we meet with here below.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In regard of meetneſs, ſuitableneſs, and fitneſs. <hi>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance,</hi> Mat. 3.8. And thus it is the duty of all that are called, to walk worthy of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. Becauſe Dignity calls for Duty; and the more Dignity, the more Duty: What greater Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then to be called to Gods Kingdom and glory?</p>
               <p>Secondly, The more ſad and diſmal any mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, the more he is obliged and engaged, and bound to God, to walk worthy and anſwerably to God who hath called him out of that condition, The condition we are call'd out of, is a condition of great darkneſs: For that is great darkneſs a man is in, which he cannot riſe out of, nor lie ſtill in! This is our condition; we can neither riſe out of it of our ſelves, nor lye ſtill in it. <hi>Therefore ariſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48564:105"/> from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> Eph. 5.14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The more comfortable and glorious the condition is that a man is called unto, the more he is engaged to God, who hath called him to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. What is good in all the world, or deſireable, but we are called to it, in this being <hi>called to his Kingdom and Glory.</hi> Is light deſireable? We are <hi>called out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> Is Holineſs deſireable? <hi>God hath not called us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, but unto holineſs,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.7. Is Peace deſireable? We are called to Peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 5. Is Communion and Fellowſhip with Chriſt deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? We are called to that, 1 Cor. 1.9. <hi>God is faithful by whom ye are called to fellowſhip with his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord</hi> Is the Kingdom of God and his Glory deſireable? The Text ſays, <hi>We are called to his Kingdom and Glory.</hi> What is deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that by our Vocation we are not called unto!</p>
               <p>But may not theſe be loſt? No.</p>
               <p>The Gifts and Calling of God are without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The Gifts of the Creation was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance. <hi>God repented that he had made man,</hi> Gen. 6.6. But the Gift of effectual Calling is without Repentance; Therefore the more obliged to God for calling; and therefore our duty to walk worthy of our Calling.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The more dangerous it is to refuſe the Call of God; The more mercy it is to be called: And the more obliged we are to walk worthy of God who hath ſo called us. Prov. 1.24. <hi>Becauſe I called, and ye refuſed, I will alſo laugh at your
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48564:105"/> calamity,</hi> &amp;c. But that I would have you conſider, in the Two and twentieth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the firſt Verſe. If you mark the Parable, you will find three Threes run Parallel one with another. Firſt, Three Invitations, Verſe the third. <hi>He ſent forth his ſervants to call them that were bidden (to the Wedding-feaſt)</hi> formerly. Then Verſe the fourth; there is the third Invitation. <hi>Again he ſent forth other ſervants, ſaying, Tell them which are bidden, behold, I have prepared my dinner,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all things are ready, come to the marriage.</hi> Three Refuſals run parallel with theſe three Invitations: At the third Verſe; <hi>They that were bidden</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the ſecond time of the ſervants being ſent to call them, <hi>would not come.</hi> And again, Verſe the fourth; <hi>He ſent forth other ſervants, ſaying, Tell them which are bidden, behold all things are ready, come to the Marriage; but they made light of it.</hi> Verſe the fifth (there is the third Invitation) <hi>And the remnant took his ſervants, and intreated them spitefully, and ſlew them,</hi> Verſe the ſixth. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve three Judgments run Parallel with theſe three Refuſals, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.24. For it is one and the ſame Parable. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.8. it is ſaid, <hi>That when the King heard thereof, he was wroth,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.</hi> And in <hi>Luke, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>not one of thoſe men that were bidden ſhall taſte of my ſupper.</hi> And Verſe the ſeventh, <hi>The King ſent forth his armies</hi> (there is a ſecond Judgment) <hi>and deſtroyed theſe murtherers; And burnt up their city,</hi> that was a third Judgment. What a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48564:106"/> thing is it to refuſe Gods Calling and Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! It is a great mercy to be kept from refuſing; and therefore if God calls, and gives us an heart to accept it, it is our duty to walk worthy of his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Worthy of God: Therefore</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When may a man be ſaid to be called? And how ſhall I know if I be truly called, or no?</p>
               <p>Thoſe that do not live under a Goſpel miniſtry, nor never did, were never called; For God does ordinarily call men by Preaching of the Word. But though men do live under the means of Grace, if they have not a diſpoſition ſuitable, they are not called effectually, though called outwardly. They have not the Wedding-garment; For what is the Wedding-garment, <hi>viz</hi> A Call to the Wedding-ſupper, to Communion with Chriſt in the Goſpel, and a diſpoſition ſuitable to accept the Call; So that I ſhall know that I am effectually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if the Lord hath put forth an infinite and an Almighty po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er upon my Soul, conſtraining me to turn from my ſins to God. Do they that are called refuſe, <hi>Go out into the high-ways and hedges,</hi> ſays the Lord, <hi>and compell them to come in,</hi> Luke 14.23. When a man can ſay, <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains me;</hi> I can do nothing againſt Chriſt, but for Chriſt: They are effectually called.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:48564:106"/>
               <p>Secondly, If you are begotten by the Word of Promiſe, Then you are cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed effectually. <hi>In</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> Rom. 9.7. How was <hi>Iſaac</hi> begotten? Not in a way of Nature, but <hi>by a word of Promiſe,</hi> v. 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you be ſeparated from the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, from the things and perſons of the world, 1 Pet. 2.9. <hi>But ye are a choſen generation, a Royal Prieſthood, a peculiar People, an holy Nation, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him that hath call-called you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If there be in you an aptneſs, a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a willingneſs to be ruled by the Word in all things, Then are you effectually called. So when <hi>Cornelius</hi> was called, and <hi>Peter</hi> came to preach to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.29. <hi>We are all preſent,</hi> ſays he to <hi>Peter, to hear all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee of God.</hi> And ſo when <hi>Paul</hi> was called; <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do,</hi> ſays he? Acts 9.6.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If you can ſay in truth, <hi>That all things work together for your good;</hi> Then are you <hi>called indeed according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. Not to them that are called outwardly, but <hi>to them that are called according to his purpoſe</hi> effectually, and truly. Do all things work together for good? Can you ſay, I was under ſuch and ſuch an affliction or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48564:107"/> and it wrought together for my good; and under ſuch a diſſertion, and it wrought for my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good: Then are you called truly <hi>according to his purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, If you hold forth the praiſes of him that hath called you, Then are you called truly and effectually: For why are you called, but <hi>that you ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes,</hi> and virtues, <hi>of him that hath called you,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall complain, I fear I am not effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe I was firſt wrought upon by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Thoſe that are truly called, I find are called by the Servants, by the Preachers of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; It is true, that God does ordinarily call men effectually by his Miniſters, who are the ſervants he ſends forth; but remember alſo it is ſaid, <hi>He ſent forth other ſervants to tell them which were bidden, all things are ready, Come to the marriage,</hi> Mat. 22.4. Chriſt ha's other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants then theſe his Miniſters; though ordinarily thoſe he truly and effectually calls, it is by theſe. But he ſends other ſervants too; He can give commiſſion to an affliction to bring home ſouls to himſelf. VVhat think you of the Prodigal? <hi>Luke</hi> 15. VVas not he brought home to his Father by an affliction? Was not <hi>Naaman</hi> brought home to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48564:107"/> God by his Leproſie? You will ſay perhaps, theſe were providentially, occaſionally. But what ſay you then to <hi>Zacheus?</hi> VVas it not a kind of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental providential Call that he had? And that Chriſt ſhould call <hi>Matthew</hi> as he paſſed by, and ſaw him ſit at the Receipt of Cuſtom? <hi>Waldus</hi> the Father of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> he and a company of his friends had ſupped together, and been merry; and as they were returning home, one of them fell down dead in the ſtreet. This was an occaſional means of his Converſion; who was ſo famous a man, and an Inſtrument of converting ſo many Thouſands to the true Religion. But ſhall the Prodigal ſay, I fear my Converſion is not right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe affliction led me firſt home to my Father? Shall <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſay, It was but an accidental thing that I ran up into the Sycamore-tree, being low of ſtature, and ſo could not elſe have ſeen Jeſus for the preſs, whom I deſired onely out of curioſity to ſee? And therefore I fear my Call was not right. God knows how to make uſe of Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, occaſional Providences, and of your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, to bring you home to himſelf. And if you be brought home to God by the hand and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of affliction, that you can ſay as one did, <hi>If my Parents had not been undone, I had been undone for ever.</hi> Be content then with affliction, and love it the better. Uſually perſons have the greateſt love for that Miniſter that was the firſt inſtrument of their Converſion.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:48564:108"/>
               <p>Secondly, If any ſhall ſay, I fear I am not truly nor effectually called, becauſe I do not know the time when I was ſo called; there being ſome that can tell you the very time, and the Sermon, and the particular word in the Sermon that was effectual to their Converſion: But I can give no account of any of theſe.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, The Sun when it comes into a Room where the windows have no ſhutters, comes in by degrees; but it comes into a room where the windows have ſhutters, all at once. Where there are the ſhutters of Profaneneſs, Drunkenneſs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and the like, when ſuch men are wrought upon, the ſun comes in all at once. Thoſe that are born of godl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arents, and have been educated and trained up in a godly Religious way, they are converted; but many times they cannot tell you neither the particular Miniſter, nor the word, nor the time when Converting grace came in upon their ſouls, it came in by degrees; ſhall ſuch ſay therefore they are not truly converted? Suppoſe a man had had the Stone, but had got a Powder, in the uſe of which the Stone does wear out by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; ſhall that man ſay, I never had the Stone? becauſe many that are cured of the Stone, it has been by cutting, and with a great deal of pain which I eſcaped, and therefore I never had the Stone. So ſhall I, becauſe I have not had thoſe terrours and troubles of Conſcience that others have felt, argue therefore I am not converted?
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48564:108"/> No, but go and bleſs God that you are converted; That the Stone is wrought out of your heart in a more kindly and gentle way then in others. I ſay, What ſhall I do that I may walk worthy of God? who hath effectually called me, and in ſo ſweet and gentle a way?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, What ſhall I do that I may walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God that hath called me, ſince certainly called I am. I am either called outwardly onely, or effectually. If a man invites me to Dinner, and I do not go, I am yet to carry it anſwerably to his love, in inviting me: Much more, when the Lord ha's called me, and that effectually, it is my duty to walk worthy of God who hath thus called me [I am come into a great and open field, through all theſe precedent Gates, I may proceed to further Particulars hereafter] at preſent only remember, That a man is ſaid to walk worthy of God, when he walks meetly, ſuitably, and anſwerably to that God that hath called him. There are four Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> hath in his Notes upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that run into this ſame matter. Sometimes a man is ſaid to walk worthy of God: Sometimes of the Lord Chriſt; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Goſpel: Sometimes of the high-call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereunto he is called. But that I may ſpeak clearly to the Point, I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe, and ſhew you how a man ſhall <hi>walk worthy of God that hath called him to his Kingdom and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that is, ſuitably and anſwerably.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:48564:109"/>
               <p>Firſt, Obſerve the Attributes and Excellencies of God, and let them ſhine forth in you, that ſhine forth in him. God is a great God; and if you will walk worthy of this great God, you muſt do ſome great thing for him. <hi>Solomon</hi> when he would build a Temple for God, ſaid, <hi>It muſt be exceeding magnificent, for it was for the great God.</hi> It is no great thing to Believe, Love, and Pray, and give Alms to the Poor; but it is a great thing to believe in the face of Impoſſibilities. To love over the head of Injuries; To Pray when ones heart is dead and down; To give Alms to the poor out of but a mite or two, as the widow did; and it is ſaid, <hi>She gave more then all the reſt.</hi> It is no great matter (ſays one) for a man to do great things; but to do great things, and to think himſelf Nothing; this is a great matter. If you will walk worthy of God, do ſome great thing for God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As God is a great God; So he is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, abſolutely free, and is determined by nothing from without, but himſelf, but onely of his own counſels; Therefore if you will walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, what is the thing wherein his good Pleaſure lies? Labour to know that: And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do the thing he commands, but ſerve the good pleaſure of God. Be ye more gracious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is ſo freely gracious.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God is infinitely holy, therefore it is not ſaid, Almighty, almighty, almighty, nor Great,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48564:109"/> great, great, but <hi>Holy, holy, holy;</hi> becauſe God looks upon Holineſs as his greateſt Excellency: So muſt you, if you will walk worthy of God, <hi>and be holy as he is holy, in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15, 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He is a God-All ſufficient, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>I am God All-ſufficient, walk before me, and be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi> You give him the honour of his All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, in being upright. When you ſtep out from God, to fetch relief ſome where elſe, you diſhonour God: <hi>Is it becauſe there is no God in</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>that you go out to the god of</hi> Ekron?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He is a faithful God. His faithfulneſs is twice repeated. <hi>Faithful is he that hath called you,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.24. <hi>God is faithful by whom you were called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.9. Then would you walk worthy of God who hath called you; When ever God makes a promiſe, promiſe your ſelf that thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath promiſed it; Not becauſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture promiſeth it, being big and full of ſecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but when God promiſeth, aſſure your ſelf of it, becauſe God hath promiſed it. This is to walk worthy of God, as he is faithful.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He is our chief good, and our utmoſt end, and therfore in all your affairs you are to begin with him, and to reſt in him, and to be boundleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable in your deſires after him. A world y man makes the world his end; and therefore is inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48564:110"/> thinks he never ha's enough of it, becauſe he makes it his utmoſt end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would walk worthy of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Obſerve what the great deſign of God is in the world, and labour all you can to advance the ſame: The great deſign of God in the world, is to glorifie himſelf in his Son. Now when a man does pray to God, and Chriſt ſhall do the thing for him that he prays for; then the <hi>Father is glorified in the Son.</hi> John 14.13. <hi>Whatever ye ſhall ask in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> And when a man does hear Chriſt, and believe in Chriſt, and obey Chriſt, as ſent of the Father; Then he glorifies God the Father in the Son.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In caſe you have any work to do, firſt go to God before you try other means; it is no great honour to God to come to him in the laſt place, when you have no whether elſe to go, and to truſt God when you can truſt none elſe. But to believe in the face of Impoſſibility, and to love o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the head of Injury, and to pray when all is dead and down; This is worthy of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Obſerve what that is that hath been your god, and give that to God. Biſhop <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (who was a good man in his time) obſerves, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſacrifice to God that which was the gods of other Nations; and herein they honoured God. If you can give that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48564:110"/> to God which hath been your God; conſider God the Father gave that to you that was deareſt to him. If you give him that which is deareſt to you, which you have made your God; This is a thing worthy of God, <hi>who hath called you to his Kingdom and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed of ſinning in ſecret, becauſe God ſees you; and be ſure you be much in private duty, for God beholds you: The more I walk in the eye of an All-ſeeing God, the more I walk worthy of God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, In caſe you do, or have received any mercy from God, be not only thankful upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a benefit, but praiſe God: There is a great deal of difference between Thankfulneſs and Praiſe. I am thankful to God for a benefit; but I praiſe him for that excellency of God which ſhines forth in that benefit.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let there be always ſomething of God ſtamped upon all that you do, ſuffer, or enjoy; Do you think that a naked Profeſſion is worthy of God? To pray morning and evening, and never think of God all the day after, is worthy of God? No, but if you will walk worthy of God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God ſhould be ſtamped upon all your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Sufferings, Company, Converſes, and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How is it with you, as to what you have heard? Obſerve your ſelves; Would you walk worthy of God? You have heard it is the duty of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48564:111"/> all <hi>that are called to his Kingdom and Glory;</hi> But Lord, how few are there that walk worthy of God, of the Goſpel, of Chriſt, of that high calling whereunto they are called? Are there not ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us that ſit under the Goſpel, that in point of Righteouſneſs live beneath Heathens? That walk contrary to their Profeſſion; Is this to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God? Are there not ſome of us, that at the beſt walk in a Legal way, as under a Covenant of Works? Either you are called effectually, or you are not; Called you are outwardly, all of you that live under the Goſpel; If you be not called effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the time will come, when you will have this dreadful Queſtion put to you, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having a Wedding-garment?</hi> Not having a Goſpel diſpoſition ſuitable to a Goſpel-diſpenſation. If you be called effectually, you are called to a Kingdom. And faithful is he that hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, who alſo will do it. <hi>Onely let your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be as becometh the Goſpel, worthy of him who hath called you to his Kingdom and Glory.</hi>
